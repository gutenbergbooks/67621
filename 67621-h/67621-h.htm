  <h2 class='c003'>PUBLISHER’S PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>In the order of nature the ideal precedes the
actual. In back-woods phrase, “The wind-work
must precede the ground-work.” “The ascent of
life is the ascent of ideals.” Ascent means action,
change, involving effort, struggle, aspiration. Aspiration
implies or pre-supposes <span class='fss'>DISCONTENT</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>The author of the story, “Hilda’s Home,”
preaches the gospel of discontent—dissatisfaction
with the old, desire for the new. With Ella Wheeler
she says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Be not content; contentment means inaction—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The growing soul aches on its upward quest.</div>
      <div class='line'>Satiety is kin to satisfaction—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>All great achievements spring from life’s unrest.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The tiny root, deep in the dark mould hiding,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Would never bless the earth with leaf and flower,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were not an inborn restlessness abiding</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In seed and germ to stir them with its power.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The author of “Hilda’s Home” preaches the
gospel of Freedom—equal freedom, the gospel of
Liberty coupled with responsibility. With Spencer
she would say, “Every one has the right to do as he
pleases so long as he does not invade the equal right
of others.” With Macaulay, Rosa Graul would say
“The cure for the evils of Liberty is more liberty.”
Hence she has no fears that under Freedom the
Home and the Family would cease to exist, or that
woman will be less loving and lovable, or that man
will be less manly and honorable. On the contrary
she maintains that only in the soil and atmosphere of
freedom is it possible for true womanhood and manhood
to live and flourish.</p>

<p class='c005'>While devoting considerable space to the subject
of industrial reconstruction, the central aim of
“Hilda’s Home” is the emancipation of womanhood
and motherhood from the domination of man in the
sex relation. “Self-ownership of woman” may be
called the all-pervading thought of the book now
offered to the impartial and truth-loving reader.
With Havelock Ellis in his “Psychology of Sex,”
Rosa Graul would say:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I regard sex as the central problem of life. And
now that the problem of religion has practically been
settled, and that the problem of labor has at least
been placed on a practical foundation, the question of
sex—with the social questions that rest on it—stands
before the coming generation as the chief problem
for solution. Sex lies at the root of life, and we
can never learn to reverence life until we know how
to understand sex—So, at least, it seems to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A word of warning: Let no reader expect perfection
in the following pages, either in ideal or in
its manner of presentation. The editor and publisher
offer this work to the reading public not for its
literary merits, not for the excellence of its plan nor
for the originality of its conception. The writer of
“Hilda’s Home” is a poor, hard-working, unlettered
woman; one whose advantages in the way of preparation
for literary work have been almost nil. The
great, the distinguishing merit of Rosa Graul, as an
author, is the simplicity, the naturalness with which
she tells of the varied experiences that educate and
prepare the various characters of her story for living
in a co-operative home. For the life history of these
children of her brain she is indebted, so she informs
us, to the cold hard facts of her own experience and
personal observation. “Experience teaches a dear
school but fools will learn in no other,” saith the
proverb. The trouble with us all is that we are so
slow to learn, even in the bitter school of experience.
In no department of life is this comment so universally
applicable as in the sexual or conjugal relations of
women and men. Hence the necessity of plainness
of speech and honesty of thought, on this subject, no
matter how iconoclastic or revolutionary the thought
may be.</p>

<p class='c005'>Prominent among the criticisms made upon the
economic ideal herein presented is the absence of all
reference to the “Labor Exchange,” and the apparent
acquiescence by the co-operators in the old
monopolistic financial system. In answer to this
objection it may be said that our story was written
some years ago, and before the publication of books
on Labor Exchange and other modern economic reforms,
and though an appendix was prepared to supply
this lack, the addition would have increased the
size of the book beyond its prescribed limits.</p>

<p class='c005'>By others it is objected that an ideal home could
and should be built without the aid of the millionaire’s
ill-gotten dollars. To this it may be replied
that the earth with all it holds, including the accumulations
called “capital,” belong to the living present,
and not to the dead past, and that if the legal heirs
of past accumulations, the Owen Hunters of today,
can be induced to build model homes for the use of
those who may be ready to utilize them, there would
seem to be no rational objection to such attempts at
rectification of past wrongs.</p>

<p class='c005'>To close this brief preface, which must serve
also as introduction and appendix, let it be remembered
that “Hilda’s Home” is offered not as a final
solution of all the problems of human life, but
rather as a suggester of thought upon some of the
most important and most perplexing of these problems.
In all great reforms the public conscience
must first be aroused to see the necessity of such
change. If this unpretentious volume can be made
the vehicle or means of helping to educate and stimulate
the public conscience to the point of putting into
practice the reforms advocated therein, the chief
object of the author, as well as of editor and publisher,
will have been realized.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>“And I may hope? You will not give me a
decided no for answer?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The time was a lovely June evening. The moon
was at its full, wrapping everything in a silvery haze,
while the air was laden with the sweet perfume of
roses and of new-mown hay. The scene was the
lawn of a beautiful suburban home on the outskirts
of the city of Harrisburg. Under the swaying
branches of the silver maples that lined the carriage
drive leading to the house could be seen a maiden and
youth walking slowly back and forth, his fair head
bent slightly forward, anxiously awaiting the answer
from the trembling lips. The flash of the dark eye
and the heightened color of her usually pale face
gave evidence of a tempest within. Then slowly the
dark eyes were raised to the blue ones above them,
and slowly came the answer,</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You do not know?” He repeated the words as
slowly, surprise struggling in the tone of his voice
as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Imelda, surely you know if you love me, if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>are able to grant my heart’s desire?” Saying which,
he caught her hand in his and drew her out of the
shadows into the bright light of the full moon.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look at me, Imelda, and tell me what you
mean! Can it be that I have been deceived in you?
I believed you loved me. I thought I had often read
the proof of a tender emotion in your eyes; and now
you tell me you do not know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Deep feeling quivered in every cadence of his
voice. He was terribly excited, terribly in earnest;
so much was easy to see.</p>

<p class='c005'>The smile that for a moment played about her
lips was a sad one. Softly and clearly the words fell
from them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have not misunderstood me. I do love
you, O, so much, but—” The sentence remained unfinished.
With a low, happy cry he gathered her in
his arms. His silken mustache swept her cheek, his
lips closed firmly over hers. For a moment all else
was forgotten; their souls blended in that kiss—a
draught fraught with divinest love. It was bliss,
ecstacy, such as only those are able to enjoy who are
possessed of a pure mind. For a few moments the
girl gave herself up to the enjoyment of blissful
consciousness. Then with a determined effort she
freed herself from his embrace, laid her soft hand
upon his shoulder and, standing with her head
slightly thrown back, said: “But—I do not know
if I can marry you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Surprise showed plainly in his every feature.
“You love me, and do not know if you can marry
me! Imelda, you are an enigma. I cannot understand
you. What can you possibly mean?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A sigh escaped the parted lips. “I mean, my
Norman,”—laying a hand on either of his cheeks—“I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>mean that I would fain keep my lover! I am
afraid of a husband. Husbands are not lovers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The surprised look upon his face intensified until
it became perfectly blank. “Husbands are not
lovers? Child, who put such notions into your head?
As husband and wife, when we are such, then will be
the time of the perfect blending of our love—you
mine and I thine. Imelda, now that I know the
sweet boon of your love is mine, I want to realize
it in its fullness. You must grant me the consummation
of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again she was folded in his arms, pillowed upon
his breast, while his cheek rested against hers. She
felt the increase of his passion in the kisses he
pressed upon her lips. His breath mingled with
hers. She felt and heard the mighty throbs of his
heart, while his love for her seemed almost to overpower
him. She felt her blood in a feverish glow as
it pulsed through her veins; it was heaven, but—a
shudder suddenly shook her frame, she whispered,
hurriedly, intensely: “No! No! No! I can not, can
not marry you. I am afraid!”</p>

<p class='c005'>With a mighty effort conquering the tumult of
his emotions, but still holding her closely pressed, he
could only articulate, “But why? Why should you
be afraid when I love you, oh, so dearly? I want
you for my own, my precious one—my very own,
where never the breath of another man can touch
you; where you will be mine forever more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And when the time comes that this feverish
love-fire of yours shall have burned itself out, when
you begin to tire of me,—always me—what then will
I do with my intense love nature? a nature to which
love is life and without which I cannot live. What
then, Norman, will become of me?” She lay back in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>his arms and again holding his face between her
hands she asked the question with a fierce intensity
that left her voice a mere husky whisper,—“Norman,
Norman, what then will become of me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Norman Carlton was more than surprised; he was
fast becoming puzzled. There was every evidence
that the girl he was holding in his arms bore him a
deep-rooted love, but that she should, at the outset,—at
the very moment of the meeting and blending
of these two intense natures, that at such a time
there should arise in her heart a fear of the future,—fear
that a time might come when his love for her
might not be the same, did not at all accord with the
knowledge he, until now, possessed of the feminine
nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>Woman, as he had found her, was only too willing
to believe all the love rhapsodies of man. If he
but offered her marriage he was always held by the
gentler sex to be the soul of honor. And really,
thought he, what greater honor could man confer
upon woman than marriage? To make her his wife,
to give her his name! Yet here was a woman who
with the intensity of a perfectly healthy and normal
endowment, bore him a love which only such an one
could give, and yet—and yet withheld the trust that
he, until now, had found inseparable from the love of
woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>She seemed to be possessed of a doubt that his
love would be a lasting one, in the face of the fact of
his having just made her an offer of marriage,—using
the argument, against all his passionate wooing, that
love would not last. He had heard, but had read
little, of the doctrines that were at this time being
agitated in society, of marriage being a failure; that
there was no true happiness in domestic life, etc., etc.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Could it be possible that this girl, who had wound
herself with the most tender coils about his heart,
had imbibed such heresies? He hoped not! The
love he bore her was a pure love, and a pure love only
he must have in return, and could a love that he had
heard termed “free love,”—such as he understood the
term, be a pure one? She loved, and yet refused
marriage. She clung to the lover and repelled the
idea of a husband. What could it mean! It was beyond
Norman Carlton’s conception of pure womanhood.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was indeed the soul of honor. He held all
womankind in high esteem. He revered his mother,
and held his sister as one to look up to. His highest
conception of happiness was the mutual love of the
sexes, the consummation of which meant marriage.
His idea of home, and of home life was something
exalted, while his ideal of a wife was a thing to be
held apart from all the world. She should be his to
care for, to make smooth the rough paths of her life,
to protect and guard her. She should be the mother
of his children. He felt, he knew his love would be
as lasting as the hills. Why then should she fear?
With conflicting emotions he gently clasped her hands
while he sought to read what was hidden within the
depths of those brown wells of light.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gently, softly, he spoke: “Why should my girl
doubt the strength, the durability, of my love? Does
not intuition tell her it will be safe to trust me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aye, I do trust you, Norman. I would willingly
place my hand in yours and follow you to the
end of the world. With your love to lean on I would
wander with you to some isolated spot where there
was no one else to see the whole year round, and be
happy, O, so happy, and yet——”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>“And yet what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How do you know that this love will last?
How is it possible to speak for the future? How
can you, or I, or anyone, control the fates that have
or may have, other affinities in store for us? How
can we know—O, Norman, how can we know? Believe
me, I do not doubt your love. I know its precious
boon is mine, but the future is dark, and I fear
to trust myself to its unknown mysteries.” And
sobbing she sank upon his breast.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here was indeed an enigma. Would he be able
to solve it? Willing to enjoy the present but fearing
to trust the future. This queer girl was conjuring up
dread, though often heard-of facts, but in his case
utter impossibilities. Trembling for the love that at
present so surely was hers, lest by some dread possibility
in the future she might lose it, yet dreading,
fearing to enter that indissoluble marriage tie thereby
securing unto herself for life the object of her
love. Long the lovers wandered up and down the
shady walk. That their love was mutual, that there
was a natural affinity between their souls, that both
possessed that in their make-up which was necessary
for the completion of the other, was apparent, yet
while he longed and plead for that closer tie called
marriage, in order to perfect their relations, she
shrank from it as from some dread abyss.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let us be happy just as we are,” she pleaded.
“We can walk and talk, kiss and sing, and be unutterably
happy when we are together. Please, please do
not let us speak of marriage. I almost hate the mere
mention of it. I have seen so much of the misery
it contains. Of all the married people I have known,
after the first few months or perhaps the first year,
generally after the first babe has come, they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>drifted apart,—they do not miss one another when
separated, and I know of but very few cases indeed
where happiness reigned queen in their homes. I
have known many happy lovers who found, after entering
into the matrimonial state, that they had made
a sad, a very sad mistake. They did not realize
what they had expected. I do not want to think that
such would be our case, but I cannot conquer the
fear of it. Let me be happy in the knowledge that
your perfect love is mine in the present hour. I have
no fear of losing you. I feel, I know, that I am as
necessary to you as you are to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And with that he had to be content, for the time
being at least. She was his by all the bonds of
affinity that nature had established between them.
He felt that she was pure and good, although he knew
next to nothing of her past life. The handsome
home that lay just in front of them, whose beautiful
grounds, bathed in the silvery sheen of moonlight,
was but a temporary home, for this queenly girl.
Her position in it was only that of a menial. Its
pretty sparkling mistress had brought her home with
her from a visit to that western metropolis, Chicago,
“A friend of my school days,” she had said. “An
orphan in straitened circumstances.” So she had
entered its stately portals as a companion to its mistress,
a nursing governess to two pretty little girls
of four and six years.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Alice Westcot was a favorite in society, and
as her husband, Lawrence Westcot, was a man of
prominence, this obscure western beauty, although
appearing in a somewhat lowly position, was, with
a certain hesitancy, but withal rather graciously,
received. To be sure, society was careful not to
make too much of her—that is, the lady portion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>it. O, woman! how cruel you can be to your sister
woman. Dainty lips curled while fair delicate hands
drew more closely dainty skirts when this unknown
queenly girl drew nigh. It is only fair to say that
she was not treated thus by all women—society
women. Now and then true worth was found under
the butterfly exterior. Women could say nothing
against her, even if they would say nothing for her.
Men doffed their hats, while their admiring eyes followed
the fair form. But there was something in
her bearing and manner that commanded their respect.
As yet no man had dared to address her in
anything but a respectful tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>But little cared Imelda for the haughtiness of
the one or the admiration of the other. Pretty,
lively Mrs. Westcot treated her more like a sister
and friend than a menial, and often in the seclusion
of her chamber, where she could lay aside the mask
of conventionality, the bright little woman had made
a confidant of Imelda. Then all the life, all the
smiles and animation, would disappear. The blue
eyes would fill with tears, and the trembling lips confess
such tales of woe as would blanch the roses on
the health-glowing cheeks of the horrified girl, while
the lips of the listener would answer: “Again!
Again has marriage proven a failure! Is it ever, oh!
is it ever, anything else?” Her lips would quiver,
the dark eyes would fill with unshed tears as a fair
face, a sunny smile, and eyes which seemed pure
wells of truth, arose before her mental vision. Then
she would question, “Are all men alike? Is it ever
and always the fate of woman to be the slave of
men?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Norman Carlton was a friend and visitor of the
Westcots, and as Imelda ever moved freely about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>house, it was not long until they met. Both frank
and pure in heart and mind, both worshipers at
nature’s shrine, it was not strange they should be
attracted. Indeed, it would have been strange had
it not so been. They loved. But Imelda’s past had
been freighted with so many dark experiences and
observations of married misery, of married woes,
that she felt no desire to bring her sweet love dream
to a sudden end—to deal it a death blow by placing
upon it the seal of marriage.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you knew, you would understand,” she said
in answer to his wondering gaze.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And may I not know?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some time, Norman, some time, but not yet
awhile, not yet. Tonight let me be happy, boundlessly
happy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So they walked up and down under the silver
maples until the hours waned. The moon had
changed her position, and the brightly lighted windows
were fading into darkness. Thus reminded
of the flight of time, they parted—she to seek her
snowy draped chamber and dream of what the dark
future might perchance have in store for her. Sunny,
golden dreams they were, to judge by the happy
smile that lingered on the lips where yet his kisses
lay warm, while again a thought of those darker
times that lay hidden in the past, would break in upon
the sweet present and like a somber cloud overcast
the heaven’s blue, so would she feel a gloom cast over
her young happiness. Shivering she disrobed and
sought her couch, that she might, in sweet slumber,
forget the world and its woes, and thus continue her
waking dreams of him who constituted her heaven.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Norman? With his head bared to the cool
air, he watched the graceful form flit across the lawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and disappear within the house. Then, murmuring,
“You are a mystery, my sweet queen, but, for all
that, my pure love. Whatever it may be that makes
you differ from other women I know that none but
pure emotions can stir that fair bosom. Good night,
my winsome love! Good night! Whatever the sad
experience may have been that has seemingly destroyed
your faith in man, I mean to win it back. I
mean to prove to you clearly that at least one man
is worthy the unbounded trust of one pure woman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A little while longer he stood, until a light, flashing
from one of the upper windows, told him that
Imelda had entered her room, and was probably preparing
to retire. Again his “Good night” was
wafted upon the air in a love-laden whisper, and then
his firm tread could be heard receding in the distance
as he wended his way quickly under the whispering
silvery maples.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>What of Imelda’s past? What were the dark
forbidding shadows that threatened to overcast
her future?</p>

<p class='c005'>Nothing unusual; interwoven only with a story
such as has darkened many another young girl’s life.
The history of one woman’s life, the threads of which
were woven so closely with hers as to hold her to
those past memories as in a net in whose meshes no
loophole had been left. Imelda’s mother, just such a
bright, beautiful and queenly girl as she herself now
was, had wrecked her life upon the rock upon which
thousands daily, hourly are wrecked. Of what this
rock consisted we shall see as our story proceeds.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nellie Dunbar was the child of poverty. She
was one of eight children, whose parents probably
could not have taken proper care of one. So, instead
of giving Nellie that which every child has the right
to demand of those who take upon themselves the responsibility
of ushering children into existence, viz:
a thorough education to develop their mental capacities;
proper care of their young bodies to enable
them to become full rounded women and men; careful,
tender nurture of both body and soul—instead
of giving Nellie and her numerous brothers and sisters
all this it was only in their very young days—days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>when the minds of children should be free and
unburdened of care save childhood’s plays, that they
were able to send them to school at all. While yet
of very tender age, when toys and books should
have been their only care, these were laid away upon
the shelf and their young strength pressed into the
much needed work of helping to support the family.</p>

<p class='c005'>Oh, ye parents of the millions! Do you ever
think of the wrongs daily and hourly perpetrated
upon the children, those mites of humanity whose advent
into the world you yourselves are directly responsible
for; upon whose unborn souls you place a
curse that is to work out its woes in the coming ages—children
who with all their unfitness are to become
in turn, the parents of the race?</p>

<p class='c005'>Nellie found work in a cloak factory, and, as she
sat day by day bending above her machine she often
almost cursed the fate that made her a working girl;
only she had been taught that such thoughts were
impious. That it was a good and all-wise “God”
who had mapped out her life, and that it would be
wicked to be anything but thankful.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Nellie’s heart was rebellious. Not always
could she quell the longings that would well up
therein. So when one day a handsome, dark-haired,
dark-eyed man found this beautiful uncultured bird
she fell an easy victim. It was the old, old story
over again, of a trusting maiden’s love and of man’s
selfish appetite. Not that he was a greater villain
than men are wont to be, but men, like the bee, are
used to sip the honey from every fair  flower hereon
they may happen to alight. He knew he would be
envied the possession of the love, the favor, of this
beautiful creature, by all of his friends, while the
possession itself would be unalloyed bliss to him.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>But a time came when his plaything tired the
man of fashion and culture. He would have dropped
it, but he had reckoned without his host. Maddened
by the sneers and innuendoes of her hitherto
companions and by the insults of men, all the latent
devil that lies hidden and veiled within the heart of
many a loving woman, was aroused. Having managed
to purloin from her brother’s pocket a shining
little toy and hiding it within her heaving bosom,
she sought her betrayer’s side. With burning
cheeks she demanded of him to do her justice.</p>

<p class='c005'>He would have tried again to soothe her fiery
blood with honeyed words, but they had lost their
power. Her faith in him had been destroyed; never
again could she trust him. He sought to allay her
fears with fair promises; he would marry her, if she
would wait a few days; he wished to arrange his
affairs; he would prepare a home for her.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young girl’s eyes flashed ominously as she
answered: “No! I will not wait. Now! instantly,
do I want my due.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Herbert Ellwood began to grow impatient. He
was tired of the scene. Curbing his temper, however,
he again made answer: “This evening, then, I
promise to be with you although you are very foolish
not to wait a few days longer, until I should have
had prepared a home to take you to.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She looked like a lovely fury as she stamped her
foot in rising anger. “Now!” she cried. “Now,
within the hour! I cannot, I will not trust you one
moment longer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The hot blood mounted to his white forehead,—Did
this pretty fool think that she could command
him?—him who had always been the darling of fair
women?—him who needed but to hold out his hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>to find it eagerly clasped by any of a dozen fair ones?
Scorn curled his lip, and the habitual gentleness
from his manner suddenly fled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Enough,” he cried.—“I am tired of this. Go
home and wait until I come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With this he turned his back upon her, making
it very plain to her that he considered the obnoxious
interview at an end. But the demon in the girl’s
heart was now fully aroused. With a quick step she
had reached his side. Despair and anger gave her
strength. By one quick movement she whirled him
round when he found flashing in his eyes the shining
barrel of a revolver.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will avenge my honor on the spot, here and
now,—wipe out my shame in your blood if you delay
an instant longer to do me the justice I demand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She spoke the words in a tragic manner. She
had worked herself into a frenzy, and Herbert felt
it was dangerous to longer trifle with her—that she
was capable of executing her threat. So he submitted
to the inevitable. With a sigh he donned his coat
and hat and hailing a hack they were quickly driven
to the nearest minister’s whose son and daughter witnessed
the ceremony.</p>

<p class='c005'>Through it all Nellie’s cheeks were the color of
blood; her eyes gleamed like living coals. When all
was over, her overwrought nerves gave way. Breaking
into a fit of hysterical weeping, she sank at her
unwilling bridegroom’s feet. Frightened and shamed
he gathered her in his arms, carried more than led
her from the bewildered minister’s presence into the
waiting hack.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was at a loss where to take her. He could
not take her to his bachelor apartments. He feared
to take her to her mother in the condition she was in,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>knowing only too well that the ignorant woman would
not hesitate to heap abuse upon her daughter’s head
when she knew all. So, after a few moment’s consideration,
he named some distant hotel to the waiting
hack driver, where, upon their arrival, he procured
rooms and saw that she was properly cared for.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was long ere she became quiet. The unhappy
girl walked the room, backward and forward, while a
storm of sobs shook her form. For a time Ellwood
feared insanity would claim her. He was not at
heart a bad man, and such an ending to this day’s
work would have been most unwelcome to him. He
had been living merely to enjoy himself, as a certain
class of young men are in the habit of doing, though
it be at the expense of some other member of the
human family, probably not stopping to think, not
realizing, what the cost may be to that other. He
had fallen desperately in love with Nellie’s fair face
and, had she loved him “more wisely,” as the saying
is, it is likely he himself would have proposed marriage.
But his fever having cooled somewhat he
recognized only too well the fact that they two were
not mated; that true happiness could never spring
from such an union.</p>

<p class='c005'>But—well, things had taken a different course.
Full well he knew that he had wronged the beautiful
but uncultured girl. He was now called upon to
make reparation, and marriage had set its seal with
its “until death do us part,” upon them.</p>

<p class='c005'>As remarked before, he was not a villain. Now
that the deed was done it took him but a short time
to make up his mind to abide the consequences, be
they what they might. He knew they were unsuited
to each other; that they had very little in common,
but he knew that she was beautiful. He would never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>need to be ashamed of her appearance. He had had
the benefit of a splendid education. He had a lucrative
position, and by casting overboard many of his
old habits and associates he thought they might be
able to get along. Then, too, she was used to work.
She knew and understood the value of money; surely
with her experience in life she would be able to manage—would
understand the art of housewifery.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alas, he did not know, did not understand how
this having been used to work all her life caused her
to hate work. As he had been lavish with her—spending
his money freely when in her society, the
idea had taken deep root in her brain that he was
wealthy; whereas he had only that which his position—bookkeeper,
secured him. She had denied and
stinted herself so long that now she meant to enjoy.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not an easy matter for the young man to
be true to his resolves and do what he considered his
duty by her. If, in those first hours when her grief
had been at its greatest, he had folded her to his
heart with real affection, instead of forcing himself
to every caress—to hide the deep disappointment in
his inmost heart—may be he might yet have reawakened
the love that through deceit had turned to
Dead Sea fruit upon her lips. Or, if she with
womanly tenderness had coaxed his ebbing love into
new life, things might have been different. But, as
it was, the hour wherein she had found herself compelled
to force him to comply with her demands and
make her his wife, in that hour her love for him had
died—died for all time.</p>

<p class='c005'>Had she been a woman cultured and refined she
would have scorned him; that lacking, she was simply
indifferent. She no longer cared for that which once
had constituted her heaven, but, on the contrary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>was inclined now to a desire to get even with him, as
the saying is. It was not a great soul that Nellie
was the possessor of. A poor but pretty—nay, a
beautiful girl, born under circumstances such as
children of her are usually born under, surrounded
and reared in the same manner, what could
you expect?</p>

<p class='c005'>And Herbert Ellwood? Ah! he felt more keenly.
The sowing of the wild oats that young men are unhappily
supposed to have a right to sow, and even
ought to sow, according to the views of some—had
only for a time threatened to stifle that which was
good and true in his nature; and bitterly in his after-life
did he rue the sowing.</p>

<p class='c005'>After having made up his mind that there was
now but one proper course for him to pursue, that
course he meant to pursue. Days passed on. He
soon found that to harvest his crop of wild oats was
not so easy or so pleasant as the sowing had been.
Nellie’s temper was the rock upon which all his good
resolves stranded. He would have taught her many
things that would have had a tendency not only to
make her a polished lady but which would have been
of daily, almost hourly use to her, but she mistakenly
argued that as she had been good enough in the past
to while away the time with, pretty enough to cause
him to fall in love with her, she was good and pretty
enough now as his wife, just as she was. She did
not understand that it was ever so much more difficult
for a wife to attract and hold a husband, even in
those few cases where love rules supreme in the home
of the married couple, than it is for a bright and
sparkling young girl to win a lover.</p>

<p class='c005'>But time sped on; the months passed by and
then came the hour when the cause of this most unhappy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>union was ushered into existence—a little
brown eyed babe. The fair Imelda was born. For
a while it seemed as if the young couple would return
to the love of their earlier days. The advent of the
little creature was something wherein they had a
common interest. But as Nellie grew stronger her
attention was all taken up by baby, who proved a
charming dimpled darling, cooing and laughing in
the faces of both parents alike.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the young mother never was the old self
again. The charming girl soon developed into a
fretful discontented woman. The man that found
life such a disappointment gave all his love to his
baby daughter and it was not long until the baby
screamed and struggled at his approach. Perched
upon his shoulder, her tiny hands buried in his
clustering curls, she would babble and crow with delight.
For the time Herbert Ellwood would be
happy, but even this sight—a sight that would have
melted most young mothers’ hearts with pride and
happiness, was only another bone of contention between
them. Squabbles and quarrels were of daily
occurrence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nellie was irritable and dissatisfied. Her health
was failing her. Herbert was tired and disgusted
with his unpleasant home, and began to spend his
evenings away from it. In consequence many lonely
hours fell to Nellie’s lot. Often her pillow would
be wet with tears. She was unhappy and knew not
the reason. She laid the blame at Herbert’s door;
whereas he, poor fellow, had done all in his power
to bring things to a different issue. He had miserably
failed.</p>

<p class='c005'>But neither knew the reason why. Both failed
to understand that as they had ceased to attract, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>they had scarcely so much as a single thought in
common, they should long ago have parted. They
were falling in with that most abominable practice
of modern times and of modern marriage,—to “make
the best of” what contained <i>absolutely no best</i>!—as their
union was miserably barren of all good qualities.
Each was conscious of a dull aching void, with no
understanding as to how it could be filled.</p>

<p class='c005'>Time passed on, and other babies came,—unwelcome,
unwished for mites of humanity that sprang
from the germ of a father’s passion, gestated by a
mother with a feeling of repugnance amounting
almost to hate. What mattered it that in the hour
of birth each new comer was caught lovingly to the
mother’s breast, when in that moment of mortal
agony the wellspring of her love had been touched.
No amount of <i>later</i> love could undo the mischief done
<i>before its advent</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some of these babes were ill-natured and puny
from their birth, born only to pine away and die,
racking again the mother’s heart. Two others, a
boy and a girl, grew to be the torment of the household
and the bane of their mother’s life. And still
the babies came, and oh! so close, one upon the
other, until the poor mother thought life was a burden
too great to be borne.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such a flood of anger and hate towards the father
and husband, would sweep over her heart as the
knowledge of each conception was forced upon her!
At such moments she felt as though she could kill
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Reader, can you read between the lines? Can
you see the hidden skeleton in this miserable home?
Do you understand how it all could have been
avoided? Herbert Ellwood, as stated before, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>not a bad man. Instead, he possessed many noble
qualities. But he was a child of modern society.
He was a husband, possessed of a wife. He had
always been what the world calls true to that wife.
He was possessed of health, strength and passion.
Is it necessary to say more? The story is a plain
one, and an old one. The thinking reader will find
little difficulty in discerning that theirs was the curse
of modern marriage life.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Such had been the early life of Imelda Ellwood.
Surely not the best of environments for the development
of a young character, but, singularly enough,
Imelda’s was so sweet and pure a nature that in spite
of all the close contact with impure elements she remained
thus pure and sweet. But early she became
disgusted with home life, measuring all to which the
name applied by the standard she had known. Even
as a child she was wont to say: “I will never marry.”
Home to her meant the elements of war. Her
brother Frank, just fifteen months younger than
herself, and sister Cora again only sixteen months
younger than Frank, were the torments of her life.
Frank’s teasing propensities were so great that he
was utterly reckless as to his methods of indulging
them, so he succeeded in making those around him
miserable. If Imelda had a new book, he was sure
to damage it in some way. If she had a new article
of clothing, he would ridicule it until the very sight
of it became hateful to her. If she made an engagement
to go somewhere and he became aware of the
fact he would contrive to make it impossible for her
to keep it, or at least to detain her so long that she
was robbed of the greater part of the pleasure she
had expected to derive from it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Cora was tantalizing, obstinate and contradictory;
always opposed to everything that Imelda
wished. Sometimes she felt that she almost hated
them. Added to this her mother cast a heavy burden
upon the tender shoulders of the young girl. Almost
always with a babe in her arms, or expecting one,
she let her shafts of ill-temper play upon her eldest
daughter. Often it seemed there was a certain bitterness
and vengefulness directed against Imelda as
the author of all her troubles—it having been her
expected coming that caused the consummation of
this most unhappy marriage. Conscious of having
in some way incurred the ill-will of her mother, but
unconscious as to the <i>how</i>, Imelda often wept bitter
tears at the unjust treatment she received at the
hands of her who should have been the child’s best
friend. In this case it was the father who proved
himself such. Early these two found in each other
a comfort and help such as is rarely known between
father and daughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>To her he imparted all the knowledge that should
have been the mother’s care, and although the little
Imelda saw but little of the inside of a schoolroom,
she grew up a really fine scholar.</p>

<p class='c005'>After having instructed her in all the rudimentary
branches, he taught her the classics. He taught her
elocution, music,—instrumental and vocal, book-keeping,
shorthand, etc. Next, German and French.</p>

<p class='c005'>Herbert Ellwood was a scholar, and he made a
scholar of his daughter. She was eager to learn, and
it was a pleasure for him to teach her. Even this
proved a bone of contention in that home,—a home
which was as unlike what a home should be as could
well be imagined. Her mother grumbled over the
wasted time, poring over books when there was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>much work to be done. Cora turned up her saucy
nose and said, doubtless the time was coming when
she would have to humbly bow to Madame Doctor,
or Lawyer So and So, or Professor of some University;
while Frank thought more likely she was getting
ready to catch some “big beau,” and maybe become
“My Lady” to some rich foreigner, some great Lord,
or something of that sort. Imelda had by this time,
to a certain extent, become callous to such taunts,
and quietly went her way, performing obnoxious
duties that were waiting to be done, with no one else
to do them.</p>

<p class='c005'>But as the years went by changes came. First;
the greatest and most lamentable of them all, was
the death of her father.</p>

<p class='c005'>For years past he had been ailing, and the time
came when he was unable to work. At first he
brought his books home in the evening, and with the
assistance of his faithful child strove to complete
the task he found himself unable to cope with alone,
and, by working hours after he had been compelled
to lay aside his pen Imelda was able to finish his work
for him. But the time came at last that he was unable
to do anything. He could no longer go to his
daily labor. All day long he would sit near his open
window and watch the busy turmoil in the streets
below. Then he become too weak even for that; so
he lay upon the bed watching his beloved child, and
wondering what she would do when he was gone.
His wife and other children did not seem to worry
him. His thoughts were all concentrated upon
Imelda, and Imelda’s heart almost broke as she
watched the thin white face grow thinner and whiter
day by day. Now and then the thin emaciated frame
would be convulsed with a fit of coughing that would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>leave him perfectly exhausted. Tenderly she would
smooth his pillows, would hold a cooling drink to his
lips, then with a firm hand she would smooth his
brow until under her gentle, soothing influence he
would fall into a light slumber.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Imelda would glide away from his bedside,
and, if possible, seek her own room for awhile, where
she could relieve her overcharged heart of the load
that was suffocating her. Tears would flow and ease
would come. Although her mother had in her early
childhood taught her to pray, Imelda never now
thought of seeking aid or relief in prayer. She had
long been a skeptic. She had seen the dark side only
of life, and she often wondered if life held any
brightness for her? How often had she asked without
receiving an answer: “Why must my young
life be so different from that of other girls?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Just at present the fear of losing her beloved
father was paramount to everything else, and while
she felt as though an iron hand was clutching at her
throat she watched and saw his life slowly ebbing
away, and, at the close of a calm, balmy autumn day
he quietly fell asleep, never again to awaken, and on
the 18th of October, Imelda’s seventeenth birthday,
he was laid away to rest within the tree-shaded cemetery.</p>

<p class='c005'>After that, Imelda had more duties to perform,
heavier burdens to bear. Contrary to what might
have been expected, her mother refused to be comforted,
and became even more fretful and irritable
than before. Imelda moved about calm, pale and
tearless, but with oh! such an aching weary heart.
But never a word passed her pale lips—for who would
have understood that ceaseless pain—and for which
she was reproached as being heartless and unfeeling.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Although Herbert Ellwood had always been able
to command fair wages, there had been nothing laid
aside for a rainy day. His wife never had been what
is known as a good housewife. She believed in
taking the things the gods provide and let the morrow
take care of itself. So when he was no longer
able to follow his daily occupation, they were without
means. His long and lingering illness had
plunged them heavily into debt, the burden of which
rested solely on Imelda’s slender shoulders. And—they
must live! Both sisters found work behind the
counters of a dry goods emporium. Cora grumbling
and daily declaring that it was a shame, and that she
was determined to make a change as soon as a chance
offered. Frank too, was told that it was time he
placed his shoulder to the wheel, as the combined efforts
of two girls were hardly sufficient to support a
family of five, for there was another little girl of two
years: “Baby Nellie” she was called. But Frank
would put his hands in his pockets, whistle the latest
air he had heard at some low “variety show,” bestow
a kick upon the frolicking kitten, make a grimace at
baby Nellie and walk out as unconcerned as though
there were no such thing in the world as the worry
and trouble of procuring food for hungry mouths and
clothes for freezing backs, or paying rent to keep a
miserable roof over their heads. Imelda’s face would
perhaps grow a shade paler and the trembling lips
compress more tightly, but farther than that she
gave no sign. From her mother it would generally
bring forth a flood of tears.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda would feel as though a cold hand was
clutching at her throat as she watched her mother.
Poor mother! What had life brought to her? It
had been one long succession of trials, sorrow and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>woes without the ability to cope with them. Once,
and only once, Imelda ventured to gently wind her
arm about her. With an impatient movement the
poor woman had brushed it aside, accompanied with
an irritable, “Don’t!” After that Imelda never
ventured to approach her again. Her sensitive spirit
had been deeply wounded, but she also knew that
her mother could not by any possibility understand
her. So she tried hard not to bear her any ill will.
She eagerly sought for every excuse she could think
of for the mother whose life she knew had been
made up more of thorns than roses.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, the weeks and months went by in a weary
routine, but bringing with them new troubles and
fresh sorrows. Frank, who had persistently refused
to put his hands to any kind of work, had idled
away his time with companions who were wholly as
bad if not worse than himself. Under the leadership
of one more bold than the rest they had for some
time been perpetrating deeds of petty larceny until
they were caught in the act. The most of them were
arrested and a term of work house stared them in
the face. Frank, however, with one other succeeded
in absconding. This was the news that was brought
home to the despairing mother and grief-stricken
sister. Never again had the poor mother seen or
heard aught of him. They knew that he possessed a
passionate love for the water and they felt sure that
he had gone to sea.</p>

<p class='c005'>And yet another trouble awaited them. Cora,
who was now sixteen years of age, and who gave
promise of beauty in the future, though as yet undeveloped,
had formed the acquaintance of a graceless
scamp, fair of face, with but the possession of a decidedly
insipid smile—a brainless fop with an oily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>tongue. The willful girl had been meeting him for
some time before Imelda became conscious of the
fact. Long and earnestly did she strive to reason
with the refractory sister, pointing out to her the
many defects of this very objectionable lover.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Cora had always been obstinate, and the
years had brought no change in this respect. In
plain words, she told Imelda to mind her own business.
A short time after she disappeared—leaving a
note stating she had “gone to live with one with
whom she could have a little peace,” as she expressed it.</p>

<p class='c005'>For some time the mother and sister were unable
to trace her whereabouts, but one evening, some six
weeks later, Imelda had an errand to another portion
of the city. Returning about ten o’clock she hailed
a car and presently found herself seated opposite her
runaway sister, and with her the partner of her
flight. To judge from the manner of both there was
little happiness or love or <i>peace</i> between the couple.
Even to an ordinary observer it would have been apparent
from the sulky and extremely careless outward
appearance of the two that Cora’s love dream
had been cut very short.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the first shock Imelda conquered her fear
of risking an altercation in so public a place and
seated herself at Cora’s side. There was something
in the defiant attitude of the girl that caused her
heart to stand still with a nameless dread, but she
forced herself to speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cora,” she said, “are you married?” Cora
paled, and in her companion’s eye was a wicked flash.
A hesitating “Yes,” fell from the lips of the wayward
sister. Intuitively Imelda felt that she was
telling a falsehood, and her heart sank within her.
She understood that the willful girl was leading a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>life of deliberate shame. Only a short time until
she would be cast off, and then——?</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda could not bear to contemplate the “then!”
With a sound like rushing waters in her ears, she
arose from her seat and staggered toward the entrance
of the car. She must get away from the near
presence of the twain, out into the open air. She
felt that she must suffocate in there. How she
reached home she never knew, but <i>that</i> night sleep
was a stranger to her eyes. The next day she went
about her work a trifle paler, her footsteps a trifle
slower. While her mother fretted over the child that
could leave her in such a fashion without one thought
of the pain she was inflicting on loving hearts, she
never heeded the drooping gait and the pained expression
upon the face of her eldest child.</p>

<p class='c005'>The winter had come and gone, and come again
and the watchful eye of Imelda detected that the
mother’s step was slower. The tall figure was
slightly bent and an unnameable something about her
struck terror to the daughter’s heart. She drooped
and faded day by day, and the much tired girl knew
that darker days were coming. Often on coming
home in the evening she would find her mother lying
on the bed, not asleep, but broken down, without
ambition enough to lift the weary head from the pillow;
little Nellie crying bitterly with cold and hunger,
or perhaps the poor baby had sobbed itself to sleep
upon the floor while its mother seemed to have lost
all interest in what was going on around her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda moaned in despair. She was needed oh,
so much at home. The ailing, wasted form of her
mother appealed so strongly to her aching heart for
the care there was no one to bestow. The baby felt
like ice as she pressed the tiny thing to her heaving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>bosom. But how could they live if she remained at
home? Only what her tender hands were able to
earn did they have to keep the wolf from the door.
And if she ceased to work? What then?</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda knew and felt that darker days were coming,
darker than she had yet known, and her impotence
to ward them off almost drove her to despair.
But the time came when she felt that she could no
longer remain away from the bedside of the dying
mother, come what would. To make matters still
worse little Nellie had contracted a severe cold, and
many sleepless nights fell to her share walking to
and fro, from the bedside of the sick woman to that
of the ailing child. One by one all the little comforts
and luxuries of former days were parted with.
Pretty trinkets her father had given her and which,
therefore were of great value to her, were all sacrificed.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the early spring the change came. The baby
had been unusually feverish for several days while
the mother was sinking fast. The night was bitter
cold and Imelda knew she must not sleep. Both
patients were nearing their end. Folding her shawl
more closely around her shoulders to be more comfortable,
she prepared for her long and dreary vigil.
Never a word did the mother speak, breathing heavily
in a dull stupor. Toward midnight she moved uneasily.
Imelda bending over her saw her lips move.
She bent lower and caught the whispered words,
“Frank, Cora.” That was all.</p>

<p class='c005'>The wayward ones, who had taken their mother’s
life with them, to them the last breath was given.
Nellie and Imelda were with her. It was the absent
wayward ones that had left a void. When the morning
dawned, it was to find the weary woman at rest;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the woman whose life had been one long mistake.
The baby moaned. Imelda lifted her to her knee,
and as the sun sent its first rays through the dim
window pane the fluttering breath left the little purple
lips, and Imelda was alone—alone with her dead!</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>After the body of her mother had been laid
away, by the side of that of her dead husband, with
the youngest of eight children clasped in her arms,
Imelda changed her home to a little attic room.
When all was over she returned to the store where
she had now been employed three years.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the early days of her engagement there she
had become acquainted with a bright cheery little
girl, Alice Day by name, with whom she had become
fast friends, although a greater contrast one could
scarcely imagine than existed between the personalities
of the two girls. The one, small, bright, saucy,
sparkling; the other, tall, stately, sad. Although
Alice did not have that high order of intelligence
that Imelda was the possessor of, yet she was so
purely child-like and frank, that they at once attracted
each other; each supplying to the other that which
she did not possess. Their friendship, however, was
of short duration. Pretty Alice had a lover, a traveling
salesman at the time, whose home was in the
east. He was about to establish a business of his
own and so would no longer have opportunities of
seeing his little lady-love; a state of affairs that did
not meet the approval of either the young gentleman
in question or that of the fair Alice. So he proposed
to take her with him as his wife.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Alice was married and Imelda saw no more of
her friend. Now and then a letter came and she
knew that the husband was prospering; that Alice
lived in a beautiful home, and that two sweet babies,
girl babies, had come to make music in that stately
home.</p>

<p class='c005'>About the time that Alice left the store to become
a wife another girl found employment with the same
firm; a tall, stately girl whom to describe would be
extremely difficult. Fair as a lily, ruddy as a rose,
with a bearing almost haughty. One moment a
laughing, rollicking sprite, the next if some unlucky
individual dared to address her with a freedom she
thought uncalled for her blue eyes would emit such
scornful flashes that you almost felt their scorching
heat. The color would rise in her cheeks until they
were stained a dark hue; her lips would be compressed
so firmly that they appeared almost white.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sometimes it appeared as though two distinct
and separate spirits inhabited the body of this girl,
so utterly would the different moods change her
from one to the other. We might go still farther,
and say there were three spirits. Three in one, for
there was still another phase of her character. In
the first, she was the rollicking, teasing, mirth-provoking
sprite, the next, she was soft, melting, a child
of dreams, and in the last a proud, scornful, haughty
woman. Talented and gifted by nature, her character
was as yet unformed. Future events would determine
which phase would predominate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such was Margaret Leland when first Imelda
knew her. The two girls were soon strongly attached
to each other. Margaret was very sympathetic and
Imelda was in need of sympathy. Misery loves company,
it is said. So when Imelda one evening told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>her the story of her life, with all its trials and
shadows,—which revelation was made after the death
of her father, Margaret reciprocated by giving a history
that was fully as sad as her own. Interwoven
with her life were just as bitter tears, and if Margaret
had not stood above an open grave her life had nevertheless
been overshadowed by such tragic events that
it took all the innate pride of her nature to enable
her to hold up her head. Probably to this very
cause was due the fact that she sometimes let this
pride carry her to extremes.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was on a fine summer evening not long before
wayward Cora had deserted them that Imelda and
Margaret had been walking together and found a
seat in beautiful Lincoln Park. Imelda had just finished
relating her story, omitting nothing of the
mistakes that had been so fatal to the happiness of
her parents. “I cannot understand,” she concluded,
“why it was they were so utterly unhappy. It often
appeared to me that my mother almost hated my
father, although he was far above her mentally, possessed
of remarkable intelligence, having had the
benefit of an education so thorough that often I have
wondered how a match so unsuited was ever made.
I have never known my father to be really unkind,
although often impatient, as my mother could be
very trying. However, I have often sought to excuse
her for that; her health for years had not been
of the best and the babies would come oh, so close!
Poor mother! I suppose almost any woman would
have broken down under it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should think so,” replied Margaret’s low
sweet voice. “Only think! eight children in how
many years?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fifteen,” answered Imelda, “and you must remember,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>too, she had three miscarriages in that time.
Yes, it was too much. Do you know,” she continued
musingly, “that the thought often comes to me, that
while lover’s love must be great, it is not great
enough, not strong enough to withstand the storm of
married woes. I have never had a lover, but have
often dreamed of lover’s joys. But tell me, where
do you see lovers among married people?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Married lovers are indeed a rare sight,” Margaret
answered, “and,” she continued, startling the ear of
the listening Imelda, “love certainly is a beautiful
dream. I know of what I am speaking, for it has
come to me, e’en that; but ‘<i>marriage is a failure</i>,’
and, as I think now, I do not believe I shall ever
trust myself to its deceiving, cruel fetters.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then what will you do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Remain as I am, free as the birds of the air.
No man shall ever say to me, ‘thou shalt’ or ‘thou
shalt not’!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda stared at her friend in open-eyed wonder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What then will become of your love?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret’s lips trembled as a sigh escaped
them. “Ah, Love, sweet entrancing Love! Imelda,
he is a fickle boy; promising you heavenly bliss to
entice you into his meshes. They sound so fair,
these promises, so bewitching in the rosy hue he
weaves about them, until——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Until what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Until you permit his alluring voice to entice
you into those rose-woven and satin-covered fetters
called marriage bonds. Then, in a most tantalizing
manner, after all loopholes of escape have been
closed, he takes his departure with mocking laughter
and leaves you only the blackness of despair. Your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>weak hands are not powerful enough to hold him
with all the man-made laws of the land. He comes
to us all unsought, in rose-strewn dreams. If you
would retain his blissful presence you must meet him
full of trust and confidence. Fetter this laughing,
happy boy and he will slip from between your clinging,
clutching fingers. In spite of yourself he is
gone. You are alone, bound to a loathsome corpse.
Never again will the sweet little cajoler walk by your
side, in the old form, to soothe your aching heart
with his warm perfumed breath. And if ever, in
very pity for you, he shall make the attempt to draw
near in another form, to warm your frozen heart,
you are forced by the cruel laws of a cruel society
with your own trembling hands to murder him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marry? No! I may enjoy a lover’s love, may
mount with him to realms of bliss, and when the
time comes that we have outgrown each other, the
time when one may be mounting too fast for the other
to keep up, as when one becomes a weight, clogging
the footsteps of the other, then at least, no unnatural
fetters will have bound us. We can still follow our
own sweet wills, and should Love again with his
winsome wiles approach me with his golden dreams,
I shall then be free to clasp him in my embrace. I
may once again be happy in the sunshine he is sure
to bring with him, and shed around him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Awestruck Imelda listened. Margaret’s cheeks
were glowing with excitement. Her eyes shone with
a splendor Imelda had never noted there before,
while the look in them seemed far-away. Where
were her thoughts? What visions floated before her
mind? Was it the lover she spoke of, with whom
she was mounting to unknown heights of bliss, or
was she looking into the far-away future where he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>was the same, and yet not the same? When Love
shall have taken upon himself a different guise than
he at present wears? Who knows? Imelda listened
spellbound to this dreaming girl, almost fearing to
break the silence that ensued.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Margaret, who taught you that? Where did
you learn to hold such views of love and marriage?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Almost instantly the entranced look faded from
the face of the beautiful blonde. That most holy glow
gave way to a sickly pallor. The lips quivered like
those of a grieved child, and the eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Experience,” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Experience? You?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Imelda. Listen. I will now tell you the
story of <i>my</i> life. Or, more properly speaking, that
of my mother; but which has nevertheless influenced
mine to such an extent that all my life, I suppose,
the results of it must walk by my side, follow me
wherever I go. To begin with, my mother has been
what the world calls ‘a divorced woman’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Divorced!” Imelda exclaimed in a startled
manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, divorced! Married at the tender age of
sixteen, she thought all that was needed to make earth
a heaven was the complete union with the man she
loved. A few week’s she lived in a fool’s paradise.
She was young, inexperienced, with character undeveloped,
else even in that short time she must have
seen and understood the innate coarseness of the man
who was her husband, whom she had promised to love,
honor and <i>obey</i>, and who is my——father! In a
very short time it dawned upon her that they had no
tastes whatever in common. A brutal coarseness
soon became manifest that caused her to shrink at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>every touch. He soon came to understand this and it
roused the very devil in him. He delighted in torturing
her in every conceivable way. He did not
even stop at blows.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>Blows!</i> Oh,—” gasped Imelda. A bitter
smile for a moment curled Margaret’s lips, and then
she proceeded:</p>

<p class='c005'>“And that man is my father. Oh, why must I
say it!” It cost her a great struggle to proceed.
Imelda asked her to refrain, but Margaret insisted
that she must tell her all, saying, “I would have to
tell you some time that we may fully understand each
other,” and in a few moments she continued:</p>

<p class='c005'>“The thought of separation never entered her
mind in those days. She worked; a slave could scarcely
have been more driven. A slave! Can it be possible
there ever has been a worse slave than my mother
was? And then the babies came. All through the
time of gestation she had to work, to perform the
hardest labor, and often my——father would come
home intoxicated and, if it was possible for him to
descend a step lower than was his wont, that was the
time. I myself know little or nothing of those days,
but my mother has made me her confidante, and
every word she has told me is engraven on my heart.
Oh, how she must have suffered in those awful, awful
times! She was helpless under his brute power, and
the relations that should only be the expression of a
pure and holy love, that should, in my opinion, be
fraught with divinest bliss, became to her the tortures
of hell. Many a night sleep was a stranger to her
eyes, and, other nights again, sleep came only after
her pillow had been drenched with tears. Under
such circumstances her children were born. Is it
any wonder that the world is filled with criminals and
idiots?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“How it was ever possible for me to be what I am
is more than I can comprehend. I know I am far
from perfect. I am terribly self-willed and can
never bear being crossed. My mother was proud
and self-willed also, and though she learned to hate
and loathe the man whom according to law she was in
duty bound to love, and though she suffered untold
agonies I think her pride, her self-respect, would
never permit her to stoop to anything that would degrade
her, if we except the fact that she was forced
to live in marriage with a man who was in every way
a brute. It is to this pride and self-respect, I think,
that I owe it that I am able to lay claim to a higher
and better nature than it could otherwise have been
possible for me to possess.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, the disgust that I feel when I hear matters
pertaining to sex made light of. These relations to
my mind are something sacred and pure. But the
sensual man who believes that woman was made for
his use only—the man who commits continual outrages
upon the woman who is legally bound to him,
upon her who bears the name of wife—such men defile
the air with their very breath.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If under such circumstances a woman in her own
soul, through her superior mind, can create and hold
a world of her own, making it possible to ward off
many evils that would naturally be the inheritance
of her children, what may she not do under conditions
that are favorable? Thus I think it was that
mother stood above my father as the stars are above
the earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I have deviated. The years passed, and
three times she had become a mother. Always for a
short time after the advent of a little one my father
seemed to show some marks of humanity, treating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>mother with some show of kindness, but not for long.
It would soon wear away and when the trying season
of gestation was upon her again he would be tenfold
worse. My mother thinks the reason for this was
that during those seasons she was more averse than
ever to sex relations, which relations on his part meant
neither more nor less than debauchery of what should
have been an act personifying and realizing holy love.
She would shrink from his touch as from a reptile.
Not being able to understand her, as he was not possessed
of a single refined instinct, it had the effect to
infuriate him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Seven years my mother led this life. Her first
born, a boy, died when he was a little more than a
year old. Then I was born. After that came another
boy. When Osmond was two years old and I
four, my mother one day, with both of us left my
father’s house forever. During the last year or two
matters had been growing worse and still worse,
until finally they had become unendurable.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My mother being a well-developed woman and
possessing strong attractive powers would unconsciously
draw the passing glances of men wherever
she might chance to be. In spite of all she had been
compelled to pass through, feeling was not yet dead
within her. An intelligent and attractive man always
had the power to move her to animation and life.
This, again, my father could not understand, and to
his many other faults was added that of an insane
jealousy. It was the last straw that broke the
camel’s back. Having been subjected to his indignities
until she was able to bear them no longer she resolved
to submit to no more. So one wet, cold evening
in the early autumn she returned to her childhood’s
home.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“But if my mother thought she was now freed
from her husband’s persecutions she was soon to be
undeceived. He dared not enter her father’s home
but when the shades of evening came she soon found
it was not safe to step outside of the house as she never
knew the moment that he, like some uncanny apparition,
would suddenly appear before her, and soon he
succeeded in making her so nervous that she was
almost afraid of her own shadow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Added to this trouble was the necessity of procuring
work, for my grandfather was not blest with
any surplus of this world’s goods. It was with him as
with so many thousands of others, weary work from
early morn until late at night, in order to make both
ends meet. The feeding of three new boarders and
the procuring of proper clothing for them was a matter
of no small importance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So having treated herself to several weeks of
rest my mother most seriously began to think of suitable
employment, and one day began the weary
search for work. Many were the disappointments
met with ere that search was successful. But at
length the tiresome tramp was ended. She had answered
an advertisement for chambermaid at a hotel
and been engaged. Little enough did it promise to
bring her. It was the best, however, she was at that
time able to do. Having had no educational advantages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>no very large field was open to her, and the
need at hand was pressing.</p>

<p class='c005'>But her trials, it seems, had only begun. It
soon leaked out that my mother was a woman with
that obnoxious appellation a ‘grass widow.’ She
was young yet, only twenty-three, and libertines,
both young and old, thought her their rightful prey.
But her proud spirit rose to the emergency. None
ever ventured to accost her a second time with undue
familiarity. It was a severe strain upon her, nevertheless,
and she had not been very strong of late.
Soon the effects of this strain became apparent, and
often she feared she must utterly break down. All
that winter she was under a doctor’s treatment, who
would insist she must have rest, absolute rest, or he
would not answer for the consequences.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But how could she rest? She had her two
children besides herself to clothe, and she could not
bear to think of being an added burden to her father’s
family. So she only more firmly compressed her
lips and bravely worked on.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No doubt she would have rallied more quickly
but for the incessant fear she was in of meeting my
father. He shadowed and dogged her footsteps. He
threatened to steal her children. He circulated the
vilest reports about her and well nigh succeeded in
ruining her reputation. When she appeared upon
the streets or in any public place she imagined she
could feel the stare of every man she met. All this
had much to do in keeping her poor in health and
spirits.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But as time passed her unusually strong nature
began to assert itself. Being freed from the curse of
sex slavery her nerves became stronger. The dark
circles under her eyes disappeared. By and by she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>began to gain strength in spite of the doctor’s assertion
that she could not do so without positive rest.
But the knowledge of having her every footstep dogged,
her every action watched, was a constant horror
to her, and she often wished—if it were not for her
children,—that she were at rest in the grave.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But at twenty-three it is not so easy to die.
The young pulsing blood courses with too much
strength and warmth in the youthful veins. So she
lived and grew strong, and by and by youth more
fully asserted itself. She again took an interest in
life and her cheerful ringing laugh could now sometimes
again be heard, making glad the hearts of her
children and friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But yet another trial awaited her. My father
was getting tired of single-blessedness. At different
times he had sent messengers to my mother to ascertain
when she intended returning to her home and
duties. To all such she made the answer—‘Never!’
So, just two years from the date she had left him, he
entered suit for divorce.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot understand how that man’s blood flows
in my veins. Of all the despicable means imaginable
none were omitted to gall her sensitive nature.
He dragged her fair name through all the mire and
filth known to the divorce court. She was tortured
with numberless disgusting questions, such as I think
no one has the right to ask, even though holding the
highest office in the land. The loathsome secrets of
her chamber of horrors were dragged into the light
of day, for the court must know <i>why</i> a woman <i>dared</i>
to desire to leave her husband.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The offensive questions that were asked her,
and even more offensive remarks made in an ‘aside’
by the prosecuting attorney, stung her to the quick.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Her white and trembling lips refused to answer but
still the torture went on. They must lash the quivering
bleeding heart until she was on the verge of insanity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then the daily press took up the refrain. My
father, of course, was the wronged party. The man
always is. Nothing of his inhuman treatment appeared
in their columns, but a blazoning of all the
lies and slanders he had in his maliciousness hurled at
her defenseless head. Oh, the sneers and the scoffing!
I wonder how she ever lived through it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I understood nothing of all this at the time, but
since I have become old enough to understand, my
mother herself has told me all the dark story, and I
never get done wondering how she ever was able to
bear it. Methinks if it had been <i>me</i> there would have
been murder in my soul. I really believe if a man
would subject me to such insults and abuses I could
in my righteous anger plunge a knife into his black
heart!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Margaret! Margaret!” gasped Imelda, “how
can you talk so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret had arisen and stood with clenched
teeth and hands. Her lips compressed and eyes
flashing, a picture of towering wrath. Then suddenly
breaking down she burst into a storm of uncontrollable
grief and tears. Imelda rose, and gently
placing an arm about the weeping girl sought to
draw her to her side.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, sit here,” she said, “and compose yourself.
Remember all this has long since past, and——remember
also——he was your father!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>My father!</i>” With ineffable scorn were these
words uttered. “To my everlasting shame and sorrow,
be it said, he <i>was</i> my father, but do you think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>that that fact would deter me from denouncing him
as the monster he is? And you can say it is all long
since past! Oh, Imelda, Imelda, in this <i>one</i> instance,—my
mother’s case,—is in the past, but oh! in
how many thousand cases is it not true today? It is
<i>now</i>, that those horrible deeds are being perpetrated.
Oh, thou <i>holy</i> ‘<i>sacred</i>’ thing called <i>marriage</i>! How
many sweet, pure temples of womanhood you are
daily, hourly defiling, by the unrestrained lust hidden
under thy protecting shelter. O, that I could
proclaim it over the world; O, that I could reach
the innermost recesses of every pure woman’s and
every trusting maiden’s heart. Beware, oh! beware
the serpent’s sting. How long, oh, how long has the
burden, the blame of the <i>downfall</i> of man been
placed upon the slender shoulders of woman, while
man stands smiling by, gloating to see how easily
the burden is kept there by that horrible bug-bear
custom. As it has been customary for her to bear it
it is supposed she always must bear it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Man sets up one standard of morals for woman
and another for himself. She, according to his idea
of the term ‘pure,’ must keep herself <i>pure</i>, undefiled,
untouched. That means, to strangle nature’s
desires, nature’s voice and nature’s longings until
some man who has been letting his passion run riot,
desecrating nature’s gifts until what remains is but a
wreck and mockery of true manhood, comes to claim
her in her inexperience. Then, in thousands of cases
he drives her to insanity or to an early grave, with
his insatiable lust.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marry! I would not marry for all the wealth
that is yet hidden within the bowels of the earth. I
will never, never, permit myself to become a piece
of property, wherewith some one man may do as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>wills. I intend to remain sole owner of my person.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda was awed by the storm of passion that
shook the stately form of her friend. Her words
seemed metallic shafts of a “white heat,” entering
her sensitive soul. Could it be possible that man
under his smooth outward seeming, could be such a
monster? Surely, surely such are only exceptions,
rare exceptions, never the rule. Her pure soul revolted
at the horrible accusations to which Margaret
had just given utterance. And, perhaps, this horror
was intensified by hearing such accusations drop from
the lips of a girl whom she had always regarded as
the impersonation of maidenly purity.</p>

<p class='c005'>And was not this girl pure? Yes; one look into
that face, shining with a glory almost unearthly, was
sufficient assurance of that. But were those accusations
true? Again the conviction forced itself upon
Imelda that, so far as Margaret herself was concerned,
those lips were certainly not expressing a
falsehood. But where, where had she learned
to speak in this manner? She spoke of the sweetness
of love and the bondage of marriage in the
same breath. How could she speak of the desirability
of the one without the sanction of the other?
They must go hand in hand, and bear the risks attending
such association. There was no other way.</p>

<p class='c005'>These thoughts passed rapidly through Imelda’s
mind; faster far than it takes to trace them. Believing
she might have misunderstood her friend she
could not but give speech to the doubts that were
agitating her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Margaret! Margaret!” said Imelda, “calm
yourself. Your words and manner are so strange; I
am unable to comprehend them. How can you speak
thus of marriage and yet welcome love? Surely I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>have not been mistaken in you when I thought you a
pure woman. You could not mean to make holy love
illicit, and desecrate it by removing the holiest of all
holy sanctions, marriage?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret’s sweet excited face underwent a
change. The color faded slowly, leaving it purest
white. The firmly closed lips trembled; the fireflash
in the eyes died out; slowly the tears gathered
in them until the great pearly drops rolled down
over the white cheeks, splashing upon her tightly
clasped hands. A sad look overspread the expressive
face as she said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Imelda, have I shocked you? When you
have been observing married people, married life
and all the consequences attending it, as long and as
closely as I have been, you will see as clearly as
I now do that of all things imperfect under the sun,
<i>marriage</i> is the <i>most</i> imperfect.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what would you do?” again questioned
Imelda.</p>

<p class='c005'>An added sadness seemed to settle upon Margaret’s
face as she answered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing, nothing at present. My mind is in
a tumult seeking to break through the cobwebs and
mists that are beclouding it. I often think, think,
think, until my brain reels and then find myself no
farther than at the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you were telling me, or giving me to understand
that you have a lover. I cannot understand
how you, with the withering contempt in which you
hold man, could ever fall in love.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Like a gleam of sunshine a smile flitted over
Margaret’s face. “O, Imelda! I am only human,
and a child of nature, and nature demands, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>know, the attraction of the sexes, and Wilbur Wallace
is a man <i>above</i> the average.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You love him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I love him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But then——how——” stammered Imelda, not
knowing how to shape her question as to how Margaret’s
views of marriage would meet those of the
young lover in question.</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret smiled. She understood what Imelda
would ask.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>He has not asked me to be his wife.</i> He does
not wish it. He loves me too well to place me in a
bondage, the chains of which might wear my life
away. He would take me as I am, cherish me as
something holy, lead me where I am weak, but teach
me to be strong.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you are going to accept this offer? or——probably
have accepted it!” came in broken accents
from Imelda’s stiffening lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Margaret slowly shook her head. “I do
not know, my dear, I do not know. Here is where
the cobwebs and mists keep everything enshrouded
in such utter darkness that I cannot see. O, that
they would either clear away, that I might see, or
that I were daring enough to explore the darkness
and daring enough to take the risks I might incur.
But here I stall. Wilbur understands, and patiently
waits. I know he is trustworthy but I have not the
courage.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And it is this lover of yours that has been
poisoning your soul with such radical ideas? O,
Margaret, beware! you know the old adage men are
deceivers ever, and I would not have my Margaret
among the lost.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret turned and looked at Imelda as if a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>sudden thought had struck her. “I will say no
more,” she said; “but I would have you know <i>him</i>,
my lover. Will you promise to meet me here next
Sunday afternoon at two? I will then take you
where you will meet many radicals, and Wilbur
Wallace among the rest. There will be a lecture,
the subject being, ‘Modern Radical Reform.’ A
very interesting discussion is expected. Will you
come, Imelda?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda’s sweet dark eyes were filled with a
troubled look, but the searching glance with which
she scanned the face of her friend could detect nothing
but the utmost purity and truth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will come,” she said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Just as the city clocks were striking the hour of
two Imelda neared the seat that the two girls had
occupied a few evenings previous. Margaret was
already awaiting her and a bright smile lit up her
countenance when she espied her friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>“On time, Imelda. I am glad. I feared you
might have changed your mind, as I had not seen
you at the store for several days. I thought something
might have happened to prevent your coming,
or that possibly I might have frightened you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mother has not been feeling well. That
explains my absence. As to changing my mind, I
had given you my promise. Do you not know me
sufficiently well by this time to know that I never
willingly break it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Forgive me, dear,” said Margaret, as she drew
her arm through Imelda’s. “I did not mean to
imply you were fickle-minded, as some girls often
are, but you will admit that our conversation of a
few evenings ago would be a stronger test than most
girls would prove equal to. But” (looking at her
watch) “we will have to walk rapidly if we would be
on time. I never like to enter after the meeting has
been opened; it always creates more or less of a
disturbance.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The girls walked briskly to the car, then rode
about thirty minutes when another five minutes walk
brought them to their destination. The little hall
was already well filled, and as Margaret led the way
up the aisle, she was greeted with smiles and nods
from all sides. It was apparent that she was well
known and it was at once observed that she was
accompanied by a stranger. Many were the admiring
glances bestowed upon the beautiful girl. However,
there was not long time for conjecturing who she
might be, as a rap upon the desk soon called the
meeting to order. A tall, dark man of perhaps
thirty years had arisen. Imelda thought she had
rarely, if ever, seen such piercing black eyes, which
accompanied by a dark, heavy moustache, gave the
speaker a somewhat fierce appearance, as in a clear,
strong voice he began:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Friends! Comrades! I am highly pleased to
see so many here upon this occasion, when we hope
to be able to offer you a by no means common treat.
The lecturer is one well known in radical circles,—a
woman who by her undaunted courage and brilliant
intellect has won for herself an honored name. This
is a time when many reforms are discussed and
agitated. Many are openly avowing their faith and
belief in this or that reform, while many more not so
daring do not openly join themselves with radical
movements. In their inmost hearts, however, they
are with us, while others again as yet are ‘on the
fence,’ their hearts torn with doubt, their understanding
still clouded with the mists of superstition
and prejudice. But as they are more or less earnest
seekers of truth, these mists will clear away and they
will be enabled to see things in their true light. Not
much more than ten years ago the word ‘socialism’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>evoked from the average man and woman only a
smile of contempt. Those who were pleased to
apply that cognomen to themselves were looked upon
as a species of mild lunatic. Anarchy was regarded
with a still stronger aversion (as indeed it yet is).
The general impression of this class of people was
that they were lazy, even to filthiness. It was
believed by a great many that the most severe punishment
that could be inflicted upon an anarchist was
to condemn him to a bath (laughter.) He was considered
a dangerous individual, as he was supposed to
be one who would not hesitate to knock a fellow
workingman down and force him to share his hard
earned wages. It was believed he was ever ready to
blow out the brains of some other individual who
happened to be possessed of a little more than
himself of this wicked world’s goods, and was considered
at best a dangerous lunatic. But today?
Even our worst enemies are forced to respect us
(applause). We know they fear us. Not in the
sense they once did, but they fear our influence upon
the working class, the so-called bone and sinew of
the American nation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are many other reforms. Each and all
have their advocates showing that the people are
awakening out of their deep lethargic sleep and are
beginning to think. Not least among these reforms,
is the reform in matters pertaining to sex. The
thinking men and women of today no longer can close
their eyes to the fact that the vices and immoralities
of the masses, as well as those of the so-called better
classes, are spreading in a manner truly appalling.
But worst of all, and attended by the worst possible
results, is the sex slavery of the married woman. To
discuss these reforms in their varied phases is what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>of the head. Her figure was too slight, her face too
pale, her features too irregular to lay any claims to
beauty, but as she opened her lips and began calmly
to speak she at once claimed the full attention of her
audience. Having arranged her discourse in a careful
manner, it was utterly impossible to misunderstand
her meaning, and as she gradually warmed to
her subject the tired look faded from the large,
intelligent gray eyes, her cheeks became slightly
flushed, the fair brows seemed irradiated with a
luminous glory.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soon Imelda seemed spellbound as she listened
to the clear bell-like voice that conjured up picture
after picture before the mind’s eye. The speaker
painted the contrast between the very wealthy and
the very poor. On the one hand rolling and rioting
in luxury, on the other wallowing in filth; the sinful
idleness of the one, the lavish toil of the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you will follow me,” she said, “I will lead you
to the homes of poverty, of toil, of subjection, of
vice and of crime, and again to where the so-called
refined elements dwell. Together we will search for
the truth, together lift the veil and seek for the
inward cause of the outward effect.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the abode of poverty we find a pale and
emaciated woman bending over her sewing at a late
hour of the night. The wintry winds howl and the
has brought us here today. Before doing so, however,
we will listen to the discourse about to be
delivered by the able lecturer, Althea Wood. I now
have the pleasure of introducing to you Miss Wood.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Here the slender, black-robed figure of a woman
arose and moved to the side of the speaker, greeting
the assemblage with a slight and graceful inclination
window sashes creak! The fire in the stove has burnt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>out. Her fingers stiffen as the hours speed on.
Upon a pallet in the corner lies outstretched the
figure of a man. From time to time a low moan
escapes the pallid lips. Beside him lie the forms of
two children, pale, wan and emaciated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why all this? Because in the days of health
and strength, when he received wages that were something
more than a mere pittance, confident that he
would always be able to provide for those he loved,
this man had been neglectful of the future. They
had lived comfortably and enjoyed life.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But by and by, because of over-production in
commodities there had come long months of enforced
idleness. Then, because of privation and mental
anxiety this man had fallen a victim to that dread
disease, consumption.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now, although and because, on every
street, magazines of clothing were overflowing, so
that there was scarcely room to store any more, this
poor woman must wearily toil by the midnight lamp
to increase the already superabundant supply of
clothing. Although and because the granaries were
filled to bursting, she and hers must go hungry. Although
and because the market is overstocked with
coal this poor family must shiver with cold through
the long wintry nights. Although and because the
millionaire and his family cannot find means or ways
to spend the millions wrung from the sweat of the
weary toilers, is this heart-rending suffering of the
poor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lightly as we entered we depart from this
abode of woe. We try the next door. This time it
is a woman’s form that lies outstretched upon a miserable
pallet. Several small children, scantily clad
are playing upon the bare floor. A young girl stands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>at the window, looking out at the fast-falling snow.
In her hand she holds on open letter. She is fair to
look upon. Decked with the world’s riches men would
rave over her. But what are the emotions stirring
this young heart? Her mother, brothers and sisters
are starving. All her scanty earnings cannot supply
the sick mother the needed medicines and the family
with necessary food and clothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just one year ago the husband and father had
been brought to this then cheerful home, crushed
almost out of the semblance of humanity, by the accidental
falling of timbers carelessly piled by his fellow
workman. ‘The firm should be held responsible,’
had been a frequent comment by those who knew of
the occurrence; but the victim was buried, and soon
the matter was forgotten by all except the bereaved
family.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Again it was a case of improvidence; of happy
content. The husband and father had lavished his
love and his earnings upon his wife and children.
They had lived and enjoyed life, without thought of
a ‘rainy day,’ and now they were destitute.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The letter in the girl’s hand shows her a way
out. She has but to give her hand in marriage to
their landlord, upon every lineament of whose face is
written ‘hard, hard.’ But he is rich, and if she
would barter her youth and beauty for his hoary head
and his money, he would to see to it that a good
doctor should be at once provided for the mother and
also that the wants of the little ones should be cared
for. If no—they owed him six months rent, and on
the morrow they would be forced to seek another
roof to cover their heads and bodies from the wintry
weather. And thus the cold, hard alternative was
presented to this inexperienced girl, this rosebud just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>opening to the sunshine of life, with its dreams of
love and happiness—the cold hard alternative of
sacrificing herself in a loveless marriage or of seeing
her sick mother and young sisters and brothers
turned out into the pitiless storm. Stern poverty
bade her smother her dream of conjugal bliss on the
altar of duty to mother, sisters and brothers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Another picture: Again sickness in the abode
of poverty. One beautiful sister bending over the
dying form of another,—dying for want of care, want
of medicine, want of food. A high fever is racking
the prostrate form and the despairing sister knows
that if the sufferer does not soon receive the needed
relief she will be beyond its need. No work—and if
she had work she could not leave the sick one, as
there is no one else to care for her. Where to get
the money to bring relief—aye, to save life!—is the
question staring her in the face, awaiting answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is a way by which the money may be
procured, and there is a pain in the look of the well
sister that far exceeds that on the features of the
unconscious sufferer. It marks every line of the fair
face; it settles deep about the compressed lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As the night shadows deepen she grasps a light
wrap and throws it over her head. She bends, kisses
the burning lips with her own icy ones and with a
gasping sigh goes forth into the chill dark night.
Not far does she go till she leans against a lamp post,
as if for support. The wind blows her scanty skirts
about her but she does not heed. The minutes pass
by until a half hour has sped, when a man comes
along, walking with a rapid step. He is buttoned
up to his chin in a great fur-lined overcoat. As he
nears her she holds out one cold, stiffening hand, as if
asking for charity, but no sound passes her lips. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>stops and looks at her. She sees he is young, but the
look in his eye makes her flesh creep. She flings the
covering from her head, showing a face of exquisite
beauty. The act has caused all her wealth of glossy
raven hair to fall over her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah! she was an exquisite tempting morsel, but
what mattered it for her! She was but the child of
poverty. When she returned to the bedside of the
sick sister, an hour later, there was an unnatural
light in the dark eye, a hectic flush on the otherwise
pale face. But the trembling hands held <i>gold</i>; she
could now procure the sorely needed help for the
sufferer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And why is all this? Because of man-made
laws; because of ‘tyranny of the dead;’ because of
the dictates of society; because of the iron rules of
state and church; because of helpless poverty in
chains of submission to accursed monopoly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Now walk with me a few blocks onward. A
different portion of the city is reached. Here are
carriages filled with ladies dressed in velvets and
furs. Their dainty persons adorned with flashing
jewels. They throng the operas, concerts, reception
rooms, while faultlessly attired swains hang upon
their every word. Their life is one round of seeming
pleasure. Daily and nightly emotions, aspirations,
good and true and pure, are recklessly trodden
under foot. Fair hands are sold while hearts are
crushed. The highest bidder is sure to win the stake.
They take the yellow gold their fair bodies have
bought them and with it deck the casket whose contents
are one mass of corruption. The smiling lips
hide the starving aching heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And whence comes the gold for which this
daily barter of souls take place? Coined from the
life blood of the poor. Every cup of the intoxicating
wine of life they lift to their lips is seasoned with
the sweat, the life blood of the toiling masses. Sighs
are woven into the glittering meshes of their silken
robes. Crystallized tears are the pearls the seamstress
has sewn into the glittering folds as she plied
her needle in the dead of night.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And the fawning swains? The lady whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>dower is the most golden is the favored one. The
oily tongues daily, hourly, fabricate the smooth falsehoods.
They swear love eternal, and for the time
being make martyrs of themselves to worship at the
golden shrine. What matters it that he has led a
life that would lay low the silver head of a fond
mother; a life that would paralyze a proud and loving
sister’s heart; that would blanch the confiding
maiden’s cheek,—could they but know. But they do
not know, and so the sensualist transmits the germ
of poison and disease to the coming generation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Women accept such moral and physical
wrecks of humanity, with hollow skulls added to
their other numerous imperfections, and in nine
cases out of ten the women are just as shallow
brained as the men they accept. While the man of
fashion is seen at the gambling table, at the racecourse
and in the drinking saloons, flirting with
gaudily dressed girls, the woman of fashion discusses
the latest style of party dress, counting on her finger-tips
how many masculine hearts have been laid at
her feet, and, in order to kill time, pores over the
latest novel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And from this seed, sown in such reckless fashion,
the coming generations are to grow. What is to
furnish genius to those unborn generations? Whence
is to come the soulful man and woman? How is
purity to thrive in an atmosphere of poison and corruption?</p>

<p class='c005'>“When we enter the realm of the law and look
into the records of crime, we find the account simply
appalling. When we read the number of divorces
granted, and the vaster number applied for and not
granted, we wonder whether there are any left who
still honestly advocate wedlock. Read the pleas upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>which those divorces have been granted and they will
show you that so long as loveless marriages are
entered into, so long as men and women are mismated,
just so long will the marriage bond mean a
galling bondage; and so long as such marriages are
entered into and children begotten from them; so
long as the prospective mother sees in the coming
child only an added burden; so long as this child is
undesigned and undesired; and so long as the gestating
mother suffers for and craves what are impossibilities
to her, just so long will there be crimes and
records of crimes; just so long will prisons be filled
with criminals.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the most numerous of the reasons
that form the pleas for divorce? ‘Illicit love’! In
spite of all laws; in spite of the iron hand of custom,
in spite of the trampling underfoot of all the tender
passions known to the human heart, that heart
demands and will have its rights. What matters it if
society has cased it in outward fetters that are supposed
to confine it to prescribed limits. When nature
demands its rights this casing becomes too small; the
fetters too weak to bind. The frail, weak human
heart expands and swells until its bonds burst and
like a caged bird regaining its freedom, the heart
seeks its mate in the free wild wood to follow nature’s
law. The divine law of freedom is written deep
within the human heart. No matter how deeply it is
encrusted under the ice of mercenary motives; no
matter how firmly clutched by social custom, when
love comes knocking for admittance all, everything,
must give way before his all-conquering power. Bar
and double bar the doors, but ‘Love still laughs at
locksmiths,’ and ‘Love will find a way where wolves
fear to prey.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“O, Love! love! love! How thy holy, thy soul-redeeming
power has been defamed! Unholy passion,
that burns and sears with vice the hearts of
men, has oft been mistaken for that holy flame.
Love, sacred love will elevate, will cleanse from all
impurities, will awake ambition, will be an incentive
to noble deeds, to a noble life. But passion alone
enervates, disgusts, wears out both body and soul; it
drags down its votaries to groveling depths.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But how seldom do mothers teach their children
the difference between the two? The smiling
mother gives her innocent daughter to a hoary head
and a seared heart if there is but a golden covering to
them. A ‘splendid match’—from a worldly view—is
all that is needed. But the sequel too often shows
how splendid the match has been. Only when the
heart is still in death does it no longer throb with
pain and sickening dread at the touch of him who
should have thrilled her whole being with exquisite
happiness. How many are able to read aright the
story in the still white face?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go visit the homes of the dead and see there
the number of graves that entomb the forms of youthful
wives and mothers. Go enter the abodes of the
insane and count the rows of staring eyes proclaiming
a living death,—all caused by the barter of sex life.
Go through the length and breadth of the land and
see the signs of heart-break; the pitiful misery that
is the lot of mankind, and all caused by ‘Man’s inhumanity
to man,’ and especially man’s inhumanity to
woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go where you will, into lordly mansions of the
rich, into the hovels of the lowly poor, and see the
subjection of woman unto man. He rides roughshod
over her most sacred and tender ideals. Every hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>in the once bounding heart has been crushed. Her
fate is to please her ‘lord and master,’—to keep <i>his</i>
home for <i>him</i>; to entertain <i>his</i> guests; to bear <i>his</i>
children; to rear them for <i>him</i> to dispose of as <i>he</i>
may see fit—thus forcing her to bring into the world
a race of slaves, a race degenerated by having implanted
in the heart of the unborn child all the evil
passions that naturally rankle in the breast of woman
so enslaved and outraged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The soul is unthought of in this reproduction,
which merely takes place to satisfy the animal in
man. The desire, the inclinations of the mother, are
not considered. To cater to the passions of man, to
be the mother of undesired children is her <i>natural</i>
sphere in life. She must thank God that she has been
selected thus to be the instrument to perpetuate the
race. Home, sweet home, has been sung until it
echoes and re-echoes throughout the land, but to
millions of women it has been simply a prison, a
hellish prison.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The church, ‘the man of God,’ its instrument,
stands upon one side. On the other side stands the
state. In case the church is not strong enough to
control woman, the state holds up to her aching eyes
the terrors of the ‘law of the land.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, the path of woman is a straight and narrow
one! Woe unto her if she dares to depart therefrom.
And yet you wonder how it is that criminals throng
the land; that there are so many that will not respect
the rights of others. Did anyone ever respect any
rights of the mother that bore them? Why; she <i>had</i>
no rights! Then how could any one respect them?
Bound by man-made law and church superstition
from her infancy her fate is linked fast with that of
the working class. She and they must alike be kept
in subjection.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“O, workingmen, O ye toilers, ye producers!
O womankind! mothers of coming generations,
awake, arise, and hand in hand, break the bonds that
enthrall you, that enslave you, body and soul. Refuse
to longer be any man’s slave. Assert your
rights. Clamor for your freedom, and rest not until
you have obtained it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is impossible that in squalor and filth, purity
should be gestated. Assert your freedom, O women!
Demand it, clamor for it, fight for it! Never for one
moment cease to struggle for it. Be united in your
efforts, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, and the
day is sure to come when victory shall be yours.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am afraid,” the speaker went on,—“I am
afraid I have been telling you more of the evils that
need reform than of the methods of securing that
reform; and, while I am radical in the extreme, yet I
condemn not one single method or idea that may help
to bring about one single reform, be it ever so
small. ‘Rome was not built in a day,’ and the world
will not be reformed in a day, or a week, or a month,
or a year. But as the days and weeks and months
and years speed by, each reform will furnish its aid
in bringing about the much desired result. Everyone
who is working for reform, or in other words,
working for humanity’s best welfare, no matter in
what line it may be, is doing his or her share of the
work, and will doubtless receive the full credit that
is due them. Only this I would add, while everyone
is riding his or her own hobby, I would look beneath
this mass of corruption and unearth the underlying
cause. To lay the ax to the root is what must be
done in order to fell the giant, and to be able to do
this we want freedom, <i>freedom, freedom</i>! No more
laws to bind our thoughts and shackle our hands.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>We want to be free, to let the hearts within our
bosoms beat as they will; free to follow the dictates
of our normal desires; free to extricate ourselves
from the old and customary when we recognize it as
evil; free to let our souls soar into the regions above
the clouds; free to enter the upper chambers of the
mind; free to tear down the structure of rottenness
that enables the few to drain the life blood of the
millions and to coin it into shining gold wherewith
to perpetuate their power. Free to use our own
inheritance, the grand gifts of nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O thou glorious, O thou great, grand, redeeming
‘Liberty’! Thou shalt yet wave over this beautiful
world the banner of holy brotherly love! Thou
shalt yet secure to us this much needed freedom.
Thou shalt yet see its fruits in the coming generation
of a new-born people,—when poverty, hunger and
misery will be unknown! When crime will be a
forgotten word; when the rule of the church, like
that of the state, will be a thing no longer remembered;
when prisons will be swept from the face of
the earth; when justice, glory-crowned, at the right
shall stand; when charity no longer has a place, since
her vocation shall be ended; when the awaiting of
unborn humanity will be regarded the coming of a
joyous event, and when disease shall have succumbed
to the master hand of science, death no longer a
dreaded monster, but a friend that comes only as a
result of nature, to claim those that have lived their
glorious life to the end, and who fain would resign
that hold upon it in exchange for the peaceful rest
that follows the well-performed labor of the day.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, friends and comrades! to hasten that day
I ask you to join the band that but yesterday was
small indeed, but which today has swelled to such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>size as to alarm those that would place their
feet upon your necks, and which will continue to
swell more rapidly day by day until the down-trodden
will arise as one man to demand their
natural birth right.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes the
speaker took her seat amid deafening applause.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>A long drawn sigh flattered from the trembling
lips of Imelda while Margaret’s face glowed with
excitement equaled only by that of the speaker.
When the excitement which followed had abated
somewhat, the presiding officer rose and again his
strong, clear, but pleasant, voice was heard. Almost
instantly the profoundest quiet reigned. His handsome
face had caught something of the general excitement
and he carelessly threw back the black locks
that clustered about the open brow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Friends and comrades,” said he. “You have
listened to the discourse of a noble woman, on a most
important subject. A noble woman, because she
dares to assert her womanhood; dares to assert the <i>I</i>.
She dares to fly in the face of custom, in the face of
power. She dares to point out where evils lie hidden.
Dares to show you where the curse of poverty stalks;
where its birth place is, side by side with that of vice
and crime. She has pointed out glorious possibilities
for those who may dare in the present to provide a
way to secure the rightful inheritance of the many.
And to judge by the applause you have accorded to
her you have rightly understood and justly appreciated
her. But notwithstanding this appreciation we
know that not all our friends agree with our lecturer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>and so, in accord with our custom we will now hear
what others have to say. We invite you, one and all,
to take part in this debate, and let us know what
your views are. ‘Free discussion’ is our motto at
these meetings.—”</p>

<p class='c005'>The chairman resumed his seat and an expectant
hush fell upon the assemblage. One, two minutes
passed; then arose a gentleman upon whom the snows
of many winters had fallen, to judge by hair and
beard, but whose general appearance otherwise did
not show old age. His business-like, “Mr. Chairman,”
had a pleasant sound, while general attention
was now directed toward him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began, “courtesy
would at any time demand of me that I treat ladies
with the greatest respect, yet the lady who today has
entertained us, and who has given us the benefit of
her intelligence and knowledge of humanity, has not
told us all the causes of the trouble. I must pay her
the compliment to say that she understands how to
handle her subject. I too have observed many
instances of despairing young girls who sacrifice
themselves by selling themselves for life, or for an
hour, in order to obtain the means wherewith to make
brighter the declining pathway of some loved one.
I have known cases wherein the betrayed, outraged
maiden had given her trusting love in vain, and was
then driven to seek an untimely grave. In the homes
of the wealthy it is a well known fact that love seldom
enters. With environments which ought to bless the
unborn generations decay and degeneracy is even
more marked than among the poorer classes, since
among the latter love does often take by the hand the
maiden and lover to join them together, and, for a
while at least, hovers over the pair. Often one child,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and sometimes more, is the result of loving union.
But where only sordid gain is the object of marriage
the fruits must of necessity be of an inferior order.
To my mind, this evil, this marriage evil, is the
worst of all evils. Instead of the home being the
birth place and cradle of love and truth and peace, it
is the hot-bed, the breeding place of vice. The unwelcome
child incarnates the germs of disease, of vice
and crime. The dissatisfied mother implants in her
offspring abnormal desires and passions because her
own desires have been dwarfed and disregarded.
Thus the enslaved mother sows the seeds of tyranny
in her child. It matters not if such a home be one
of plenty or want. One breeds the roue, the other
the criminal of the future. I only wish to state here
that so long as the people bow to an ‘unknown God’;
a God who is supposed to rule somewhere up among
the stars, in a place called heaven; a God who will
punish those who have been truer to nature than to
the impossible teachings of the church, by burning
them in everlasting fire, and so long as the people
sustain a state or government that holds them in
bondage; a state to which they must pay tribute for
every privilege they enjoy, even unto the privilege
of choosing a mate; so long as the credulous people
pay tribute to the parasites called politicians who
fasten themselves wherever they can find a foothold,
just so long must we continue to endure the evils
portrayed by the last speaker. So long as labor is a
slave to capital, so long as the workingman is but an
irresponsible part of the machinery that produces
wealth for the few, just so long will woman be a
slave to man, and just so long will children be a curse
instead of a blessing, and just so long will crime and
disease stalk abroad. The workingman must first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>strike for and gain his freedom. Then the emancipation
of woman will follow. I have nothing farther
to say.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Amid appreciative applause the man of many
winters resumed his seat. Next arose a man with
snapping black eyes and jetty hair who with cutting
sarcasm dissected the lecture, telling his hearers that
in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred all the poverty,
the ill-luck, was due to the man or woman’s own
fault. “The working people,” said he, “as a class,
are lazy; they are extravagant; they are vicious.
They would rather spend their leisure time in saloons,
swilling beer and poor whiskey, and in playing cards,
than with their families at home; they would rather
lounge and loaf upon street corners than do an honest
day’s work; they would rather follow a course that
would lead them to steal, and even murder, and
thereby get them into the penitentiary where they
would be only too well treated. If it were not for
the church who with her gentle and peace-diffusing
influence keeps the working classes in a measure
content, and under control, there would be no telling
to what deeds of outrage the ignorant, licentious
masses of people would go. Take away the influence
of religion and what would be the result? Without
fear of a god or devil, like a brutal horde of wild
beasts with nothing to restrain them, they would fall
to murdering and plundering everything and everyone
that stood in their way, regardless of consequences,
just so they could satisfy their ungovernable
appetites.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The only thing this man could think of that could
be done was to make more laws; laws more stringent
and binding. Then enforce them to the letter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We speak of loose morals,” said he. “Could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>there be anything more loose than the ideas of marriage
that are fast becoming popular? There are
almost as many divorces petitioned for and granted
as marriages entered into. Divorces are too easily
obtained. The laws are too lax. If such were not
the case people would be more careful in entering
the holy portals of marriage. But there are so few
that any longer consider marriage as something holy
that it is becoming a menace to the country. Again
I ask for more laws. Let them be stringent and let
them be rigidly enforced. Let those that are forming
such contracts and entering into the bonds of
marriage, understand that it is for life, that there is
no escaping the consequences, and then people will
get along better.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>There was not much applause this time, when
the speaker resumed his seat. Some few laughed,
but here and there, as you cast your eye over the
audience, you could see compressed lips and flushed
cheeks. But as the platform was a free one, where
everyone was invited to freely speak his convictions,
no one attempted to interrupt the speaker, although
many felt the hot blood of indignation mount to their
cheeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>Almost immediately upon his resuming his seat
a woman rose, and, upon addressing the chairman,
had the right to speak accorded her. A woman
probably forty years of age, but looking nearer
thirty. A woman who in her youth might have been
handsome and who was yet passably fair. Of figure
she was tall and well developed. The light brown
hair was combed back so as to leave the low brow
free and uncovered. The blue eyes were sparkling
with a light that was not caused by a sense of pleasure.
The finely curved lips were quivering with
suppressed emotions as she fearlessly walked forward
and faced the audience.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Friends! Comrades!” she began, with a voice
both clear and strong. “It is not often that I feel
myself called upon to make any remarks at these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>meetings. My sentiments generally are so clearly
expressed and so well defended by those who are better
able to treat the subjects that as a rule are under
discussion here, that I find more pleasure and benefit
in listening to others than in taking part in discussion.
But this afternoon I feel impelled to make a few
remarks, hoping that you will bear with me if I am
not able to express myself quite as concisely and correctly
as I might wish. I do not wish to find fault
with our lecturer in regard to what she has said, but—if
it could be called a fault—with what she did not
say. Although she has painted you pictures most
dismal and saddening I can assure you the half, nay,
the one tenth has not been told. Methinks there are
some things that she has too lightly touched upon,
and which our friend, Mr. Roland, has somewhat
more plainly pictured. The ‘looseness’ that Mr.
Warden so much deplores in divorce laws does not
exist. In fact these laws are so stringent as to place
the possibility of obtaining a divorce beyond the
reach of the poor. Divorce laws, like all other laws,
are for the special benefit of the moneyed class.
They can avail themselves of divorce if they see fit,
and that they do see fit rather often is quite evident.
And for once I must give the privileged class credit
for something. Notwithstanding Mr. Warden’s
lament that divorces are so easily obtained I claim
there is nothing more difficult. The most excruciating
torture that it is possible to inflict upon a sensitive
and refined woman is to drag her into our modern
courtroom and subject her to the quizzing process
of shameless lawyers, who ply her with numberless
questions that cut to the quick the sensitive heart
and lacerate it as though some diabolical machine
filled with knives of all shapes and sizes were making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>mince-meat of it. These lawyers luxuriate in cruelly
delving in these wounded and bleeding hearts so that
it takes a woman of tremendous courage to willingly
undergo this dissecting operation, and therefore
comparatively few seek the redress of the law. It
drags forth, into a foul atmosphere, the most sacred
treasures, and defiles them with the vileness that so
often is found in the precincts of the law. It hurls a
woman from her pinnacle of respected womanhood
into the depths of disgrace. It prohibits her from
the companionship of the good and pure. It ostracises
her from what is called ‘good society,’ it points
the finger of scorn at the child that calls her ‘mother.’
If that child be a boy there is a chance for it to
win its way in the world, but if it be a girl then hard
will it be for her to gain a foothold upon the steep
and rugged pathway she will have to climb.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How can a sensitive, womanly woman desire
to confront a room filled with coarse, unsympathizing
men and relate to them the stories of her woe?
How can she tell of tears shed in the dead of night;
of how her sacred womanhood has been abused; of
how her outraged person is forced to submit to his
loathsome touch? Broken down, suffering from oft-repeated
child-bearing, tired unto death with her
manifold duties, sick in soul as well as in body, I say
how can she tell all this, with all those strange leering
faces about her? She would rather go on suffering
until death comes to her release, or perhaps her
overburdened brain gives way, while the world
wonders: ‘What could have been the reason? She
had such a good, industrious, sober husband, who has
always so handsomely provided for her every want,
and such a nice large family of children growing up
around her. How could she have been else than
happy?’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“They really cannot understand what could have
caused her brain to give way. Aside from this, not
everywhere is it possible to obtain a divorce for such
reasons as I have just mentioned. In some states if
she is not treated to blows, neglected with her children
to such an extent that cruel want speaks from
the hollow eyes and sunken cheeks, she will be told
she has no just cause for complaint, and should go
home submissively to her liege lord and master,
thankful for the home provided for her, and should
bow her head in humility to the great and all-wise
God who has made all things well.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, it is a noble sphere that has been marked
out for woman—marked for her by her owner, her
lord, her master! Why cannot she be content, why
cannot she be satisfied? Aye, satisfied! O, if she
could only be aroused to universal dissatisfaction,
there would be hope for her emancipation in the near
future.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Our friend, Mr. Roland, has made the remark
that in order to free woman, man, the workingman,
must first be freed,—the economic conditions must
first undergo a universal change. Then why, in
freedom’s name, is woman’s cause not more frequently
urged as an argument to that end? O, that
woman herself would only awake to a sense of her
condition! O, sisters, awake! Hasten the advent of
the coming day that proclaims your freedom from the
tyranny of man, by aiding him to obtain the rights
that are justly his. Lend your aid in freeing man
from the thralldom of state and monopoly, and ever
bear in mind that the same blow which shatters your
brother’s fetters will also free you. That which insures
his freedom and independence will do the same
for you. For when the day comes in which justice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>reigns, she can no longer stand with blindfolded eyes
while woman’s life is fettered.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As the speaker ceased, and the applause burst
forth, Imelda bent her head near Margaret, whose
cheeks glowed like twin roses.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who is she?” she asked, and Margaret in
answer whispered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“My mother!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>For an instant Imelda was startled. She had
never seen Mrs. Leland and had pictured to herself a
different woman; but as she looked again she could
see the likeness between mother and daughter, and
there crept into her heart a thought of her own
mother, and she contrasted the weary, fretful, listless
woman with this mother of her friend, who, after
the life of trials and sorrows that had been hers, had
arisen in such splendid self-confidence; who had
burst the chains that bound her; who now dared to
hurl such scathing truths, like firebrands into a magazine
of powder, as it were, ready to stand by the
result the explosion must bring forth. She began to
understand the source whence her young friend
received her strength of character.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Leland’s words, even more than those of the
lecturer, burned into her heart as her thoughts
wandered to her almost worshiped father, now sleeping
under the ground. Over her tortured heart crept
a fear that possibly even he had not been to that
fretful, oft-times unjust mother, all that he might
have been. There might have been pitfalls carefully
hidden from her sight—for her mother never made a
confidante of her child. But she knew of the inharmonious
life that had been theirs. She could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>remember ever having caught sight of the holy
flame of love between them. And yet—the babes
had come. She knew the mother had not desired
them. She felt dazed. Her head swam, as these
thoughts coursed through it in much less time than it
takes to trace them here.</p>

<p class='c005'>But again someone was speaking, and again the
horrors of married life were pictured. How woman
is sold! Woman has no outlet for her overcharged
feelings save in tempestuous temper and tears.
Generally, in time, the temper is subdued and the
tears alone remain, and the world wonders why woman
so soon loses her attractive powers; why the
sparkling girl overflowing with magnetism turns so
soon into the pale, weary, hollow-eyed woman who
finds life’s happiness turned to Dead Sea fruit upon
her lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Imelda listened she felt as though a cold hand
were clutching at her throat. The world seemed
slipping from beneath her feet. Then another rose
and in his turn spoke of the holiness of marriage, of
the holiness of the church, of the holiness of the state.
Like hollow mockery the words echoed and re-echoed
in Imelda’s ears. What could be holy now after she
had seen the evil withdrawn and the sickening truth
exposed to view. Like one in a dream she listened
and wondered that any one could still be sincere in
uttering such words as in all good faith this man
seemed to speak. It seemed as if, all in a moment,
where had heretofore appeared rose-strewn paths,
she now saw only pitfalls whose yawning depths
were ready to engulf those who foolishly set their feet
upon the treacherous edge. Still, as in a daze, she
realized that the speaker was done, that once more
Althea Wood was speaking. The clear, sweet voice
resounded through the room.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“My friends,” she said, “it would be indeed
difficult to express the pleasure I have felt listening
to the discussion this afternoon. Nor can I express
how thankful I am that my cause has been so warmly
championed, notwithstanding the efforts of those who
cannot as yet see this question in the new light in
which it is viewed by many of you. I agree with
those of my friends who claim that this vexed question
does not receive the attention that it deserves.
It is sad and pitiful, but true, that the average man
and woman are so unwilling to hear this subject discussed
that it requires a great effort to speak of it.
They may be willing to pick up a book that treats on
this subject, and, screened in the seclusion of a
private room, try to digest the writer’s ideas, but
under the fire of other eyes to hear from the lecturer’s
lips these tabooed subjects is quite another
thing. So long, however, as sex is considered impure,
something for which the human race should
blush, just so long will it be not only a difficult but
painful subject for lecturers to discuss. The consciousness
that we would probably be misunderstood
is unpleasant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, that I might live to see the hour when this
beautiful earth shall be freed from the crushing fetters
of custom; from the deadly poison of superstition
and prejudice; from the grinding heel of monopoly,—to
see a race of men and women enlightened,
liberated, self-reliant, free. Not an enforced freedom,
keeping them ever on their guard, fearing the
lurking enemy in the entrenchments, back of the
bulwarks of authority and the fortifications of avarice
and low desires. No! the time for such hypocrisy
will then have vanished. We shall then hail the
time when a race of freemen shall exist because of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the universal demand for and recognition of it. The
race will have become purified in the fires of truth,
love and justice. When it shall have risen to the
height where it will have attained the full knowledge
of its worth; where and when it shall have demanded
its rightful birthright, the right to own itself; the
right to the product of its toil; the right to recognize
truth wherever it is found.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just so soon as you make that demand, earnestly
and sincerely, your right will have come to you.
Begin with recognizing the great truth that you are
an individual, that you are rightfully sole owner of
your own mind, of your own brain capacity. Let
no outside influence enthrall you; break your chains,
set your mind at liberty, and it will soon work out
the salvation of the body. When once you can see
that there are fetters the desire to break them will
come; the effort to break them will follow the desire.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Before I close I will say to my Christian critics
that if there were not so many laws there would not
be so much of the ignorance of which they now complain.
Laws and customs keep the masses in the old
ruts, destroying the strength wherewith they otherwise
could elevate themselves to nobler heights. To
the everlasting disgrace of the church it must be said
that its influence keeps the deluded masses in their
benumbed condition, content to spend their miserable
lives in abject slavery. Pitiable is the fact, but
cruelly true, that many of them desire nothing more
ennobling than to seek oblivion of their troubles in
the depths of the intoxicating bowl.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But Freethought is not the cause of this desire.
Her mission is to break the fetters that bind man’s
mind; to sweep away the cobwebs and mists of superstition;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>to slay the tyrant prejudice that bars the
entrance to the new and the true.</p>

<p class='c005'>“When the truths of science shall have been
mastered by the law-ridden and priest-ridden people,
when they shall have obtained the right to own themselves,
then with the disappearance of ignorance
will also disappear vice and crime. My heart aches
at sight of this poor, deluded, cheated people, daily
robbed more and more by laws that were made for
none but slaves to obey. The rich man makes them
and of course never expects to come in contact with
them otherwise than to inflict them upon those who
produce his wealth. Love needs no fetters. Nothing
binds human hearts but Love.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So, once again I urge you to awake; to come to
a realization of your own thralldom, and then in turn
to help others to awake to a consciousness of this
yoke of slavery borne by you all. Then the world
will move onward; will move rapidly toward that
millennium that is to be the realization of evoluted
humanity.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>As the meeting was dismissed, all in a moment
the earnest truth-seekers were transformed into a
social assemblage. Hearty handshaking abounded
and equally hearty laughter was heard upon all sides.
For several minutes it seemed to Imelda that she had
been forgotten by her friend who had been joined by
the chairman of the afternoon, but she had more
than enough to occupy her mind in observing the
scene before her, and reviewing the two hours she
had just passed through. Many and conflicting were
her emotions. Every word, almost, that had been
spoken had sunk deep into her heart and she again
experienced all the sensations of surprise and indignation
she had felt, the mere memory of which
almost caused her heart to stand still and chill the
blood in her veins. Never in all the years of her
young life had she dreamed of such dark depths of
hopeless woe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just then a hand lightly touched her arm and
she heard Margaret’s sweet voice:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Imelda, my dear friend, permit me to introduce
to you another friend, Mr. Wallace.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda suddenly found herself confronted by the
chairman of the meeting. The interruption was
opportune, as it recalled her to herself. Wilbur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Wallace’s darkly bronzed face was all aglow. A
happy light shone from the dark eyes and the clear
strong voice had a ring in it that could have been
caused only by something very pleasant. The next
moment Imelda’s hand was folded in his strong clasp
while the words: “I consider myself fortunate in
meeting Miss Ellwood here this afternoon,” most
pleasantly struck her ear, and he continued: “I very
much hope that the pleasure may be often renewed.”
Imelda felt the icy clutch slowly being removed that
had been holding her enthralled; a more life-like
smile lit up her face as she replied:</p>

<p class='c005'>“The pleasure will be mutual, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then we may hope to see you here again?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not?” she asked. “I have heard much
this afternoon which, although not pleasant in itself,
was both new and interesting, and I have no doubt I
shall be able to learn much here which would be impossible
for me to learn elsewhere. While the facts,
as they have been shown here today, are almost impossible
to believe, yet if true, it is time I knew
something about them. But I cannot see the remedy;
how do you propose to alleviate, or rather to banish
such evils?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda’s dark eyes looked questioningly into the
now serious face of Wilbur Wallace, whose answer
promptly came.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The solution of that problem will, no doubt,
be the work of future years, albeit much can at the
present time, and also in the near future, be done to
make the way clear. ‘Making the way clear’ is
what we trying to do. This is a meeting place
for thinkers—free thinkers, all of them, and no matter
what their ideas of God, of the church, may be,
they all have come to the conclusion that there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>something wrong somewhere, and that church and
state bear a large share of the blame, is plainly to be
seen. The so-greatly despised ‘anarchist’ is, I think,
more largely represented than others.” There was
a quick uplifting of the brow of the young girl at the
mention of the word ‘anarchist.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not understand,” she said. “The colors
wherewith I have seen the name painted are not
very attractive. If I have had a mistaken impression
I would like to have my error corrected.” At this
moment the old gentleman, Mr. Roland, accompanied
by Miss Wood, stepped up to the little group.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What matter of importance is being discussed
here with so much interest?” broke in his pleasant
voice. “I must confess to a desire to join with you,
but first permit me.” Here followed the necessary
introductions, then Wilbur Wallace spoke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Ellwood being a stranger to our circle, is
also a stranger to the ideas usually discussed here.
Consequently she finds them not unmixed with a
certain amount of gruesomeness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what particular idea, or object, or fact,
is it that fills you thus with unpleasant feelings?”
asked Mr. Roland of Imelda.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think almost everything that I have heard
spoken of here today. If all I have heard here today
be true, every young girl would be justified in shrinking
from marriage as she would from the brink of a
dark abyss.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is well expressed,” said Miss Wood; “and
if we could but impress that idea upon the mind of
every woman there would soon be a new state of
affairs. When woman learns the true worth of herself
she will insist on the right to dispose of herself
as she will see fit, and not as she is commanded to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>by the arbitrary laws of a society that is man-made.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For a few moments Imelda was lost in thought,
then her dark eyes flashed upward.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I understand that if woman could be successful
she would be able to enjoy a glorious freedom. But
would not this very freedom have some very undesirable
results? Undesirable as a large family of
children may be to the majority of women, as it most
inevitably dooms them to a life of drudgery, yet
under circumstances of unlimited freedom, such as
you advocate, how long would it be until the race
would begin to dwindle away? For many women,
as I know them, would prefer not to be mothers at
all, and very few of them would wish for a large
family. We all know that the life of the infant is
but a tender plant that sometimes does not long survive
the hour of its birth. Do you think such a state
of things would be desirable?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Miss Ellwood,” Mr. Roland replied,
“the idea of the extinction of the race would indeed
not be pleasant to contemplate, but the perfect freedom
of woman would naturally overcome the very
dangers you fear. The desired and gladly welcomed
child will of necessity be superior to that which is
undesired and unwelcome. When a prospective
mother is filled with thoughts of that coming event
she lives during that period only for the well being
of that mite of humanity. She will seek to observe,
to study, the laws of nature to their fullest extent,
and being in the possession of sexual freedom will
soon learn to understand these glorious laws. So
children will be born into the world in a more normal
and healthy state than is now the case, and the result
will be fewer little graves. Then again woman will
develop mentally and she will bestow upon her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>unborn babe a legacy of brain power that at present,
under our corrupt social system, is an utter impossibility.
So even though there would not be so many
undesired unfortunate beings called into life the
quality would be so vastly superior that the loss in
quantity would be anything but loss,—rather gain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I agree with you,” Imelda said, “but here the
question arises, How will woman be enabled to gain
this freedom that is to bring about so many desirable
results?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Young Wallace made answer:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Woman’s awakening to the consciousness that
it is needful will be the cornerstone upon which her
freedom will be built, but she will need the help and
support of outward influence. So long as man is the
slave of ‘the almighty dollar,’ so long will woman
be the slave of man, because in the present state of
society she is dependent on man for her maintenance.
The economic battle goes hand in hand with that for
woman’s rights. Man needs woman’s aid in this
battle for the rights of humanity, and the blow that
shatters the shackles of wage-slavery will also break
the chains that hold her sex in bondage. When the
race becomes free her battle will have been won, and
she can begin to build up a new and glorious race.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Wallace’s eyes glowed as the enthusiasm wherewith
he had spoken sent the blood bounding through
his veins. Imelda saw that Margaret’s eyes rested
with something more than mere admiration on his
darkly handsome face. All in an instant she understood—“Margaret’s
love.” It shone in the depths
of her deep blue eyes, it trembled upon the sweet,
dewy lips, it burned in the glow of her cheek.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda’s eyes reverted again to the face of the
young man with renewed interest; but her searching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>glance could detect nothing to his discredit. It was
a frank, open, manly countenance wherein she gazed,
a face women would involuntarily trust and little
children love.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At the same time,” now spoke Miss Wood,
“you will permit us to begin to exercise just a little
of that freedom now. We will begin at home with
our individual selves and proclaim that no man shall
ever say to us, ‘Thou shalt,’ or ‘Thou shalt not.’
How is it Miss Ellwood and Miss Leland?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The question was put rather laughingly and
banteringly, as she turned first to one, then the other
of the two girls. Imelda had no answer but a heightened
color, but Margaret held out her hand which
Miss Wood readily clasped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am with you,” she said. “I intend to win
my lover’s love and hold it too, but I will never buy
it at the price of my freedom.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bravo!” came simultaneously from the lips of
the gentlemen, while the hand of the elder gently
patted her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is what I call making remarkably free
with my daughter. She belongs to me and I object,”
and the pleasant face of Mrs. Leland became visible
in close proximity to her daughter and Mr. Roland.
Margaret’s laugh rang out in sweetest music.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now! now! Mamma, you know better than
that. If I am your daughter, I am not your property.
Don’t you know if I find pleasure in feeling
Mr. Roland’s hand on my shoulder—why—you have
nothing to say.” This last was said in so saucy a
manner that it caused a general laugh, which having
subsided, she with sudden recollection added:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pardon me. I almost forgot, mamma,—this
is the very dear friend I have so often told you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>about,—Imelda Ellwood.” Mrs. Leland’s eyes rested
for a moment searchingly upon the face of the young
girl; then, satisfied with what she saw there, clasped
both hands in hers and in a few words caused her to
feel quite at her ease. Then seating herself, she said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Proceed now. I know that I have broken into
the midst of something very interesting.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only a continuation of our discussion,” replied
Mr. Roland. “We have been considering the rights
of women in particular, and those of humanity in
general. The reason in this case is, to convince a
beautiful woman and win her as a convert,” bowing
to Imelda, “which I hope is justification in this case
for becoming eloquent. I can assure you that you
have missed something, Mrs. Leland.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, if such is the case, I am sorry, but who
is the convert that is to be? You, Miss Ellwood?”
looking inquiringly into Imelda’s face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just so,” she answered, “and if I can gain a
clearer insight into things, the efforts of my friends
may prove successful. But I must remark that I
seem to have gotten into a very pronounced set of
radicals.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you frightened?” asked Wilbur Wallace
with a laugh, in which the rest joined.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not in the least,” she retorted, “although the
term ‘radical’ always left the impression on my mind
of something of a rather wild character. But really,
if what I have seen of them this afternoon are fair
specimens, they are a very well behaved species.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A general laugh followed. Mr. Roland pronounced
it almost six o’clock and time to disperse.
As a parting admonition Miss Wood turned to
Imelda.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You seem to be a young woman of more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>ordinary intelligence. It is such as you whom we
wish to win, to take an interest in the fate of womankind,—in
the fate of humanity. Permit your friend,
Miss Leland, to induce you again to join this circle,
and I hope when next I see you that I will find you
one of us, heart and soul. Good bye, now, friends,
may your every effort be blessed with success.”
With these words they parted, she clinging to the
arm of Mr. Roland, leaving our little group of four
alone. Arriving at the outside they found that it
had already grown quite dusk. For a moment there
seemed to be an indecision on the part of Margaret
and Wilbur as to which direction they should take,
when Mrs. Leland decided the matter for them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come with me to the nearest car, Margaret.
It will take me almost to our door, so I can very
well go alone, while you and Wilbur can accompany
Miss Ellwood to her home.” Imelda protested, saying
she was as well able to go alone as Mrs. Leland,
but the elder lady insisted, supported by her young
friends, and as a matter of course carried the day.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By the time you return,” she said, “I will
have luncheon ready. Good night, now, Miss Ellwood,
I will not say good bye, as I hope to see you
often.” Waving her hand in adieu, she mounted
the car and was gone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Five minutes walk in another direction brought
them to the car that it was needful to take to reach
Imelda’s home, and soon they were being whirled
along to their destination. The car was almost
deserted, which gave them an opportunity to continue
their conversation. Margaret did not say
much, but seemed rather to enjoy listening to her
friend and lover as they traversed the same ground
that she had passed over not so very long since, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>although the daughter of a radical mother, that
mother had not always been radical. The time
was not very far gone by when the old prejudices
still held her in bondage, and the fear of what the
world might say, restrained her in all she would say
and do.</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret long felt the influence of those earlier
teachings. It had been harder for her to break away
from the old beliefs and superstitions than for her
mother; but—“Love works wonders” was true in
this case. Wilbur Wallace was of that type of men
who are sure to win conviction where once they gain
a foothold. Gifted with a bright intellect and a
manner of speech both positive and fluent, he carried
conviction to the minds of his hearers. It had
been at an entertainment, to which she had accompanied
her mother, that Margaret had first met Wilbur.
The young couple had from the first been
attracted, which attraction soon ripened into more
than mere friendship.</p>

<p class='c005'>But young Wallace was not without bitter experience;
as he had observed home and family life
he had found it anything but perfect. He had seen a
sweet and gentle mother suffer from the arbitrary
monogamy of her married life to such extent that
it had laid her in an early grave. The lesson of the
ending of that life had entered like a corroding iron
into the soul of her first born, a boy then but eighteen
years of age. From the hour his idolized mother was
laid beneath the green sod he had never entered his
father’s home. Life was a problem he had set himself
to study, and the more he studied the greater
the problem became. But he was not easily daunted.
He kept his eyes open, thus soon discovering that
the world was full of wrongs that needed righting.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Soon Wilbur Wallace’s name was classed among
those who were laboring in the cause of the poor and
lowly. But woman’s cause seemed ever to lie nearest
his heart. The memory of one sweet woman lay
enshrined within the depths of his heart; for her
sake he sought for truths that should be the means of
saving other women from a like heart-break. The
faces of two weeping girls, as he had seen them last,
would arise before his mind’s eye, and more firmly
than ever did the resolve become rooted to save them
from a like fate. The years had rolled by; he was
twenty-seven and his sisters young women of twenty
and twenty-three. He had never seen them again,
for many miles separated him from the place that
had known his childhood days.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Then had come the hour of temptation to him.
Sweet Margaret had come into his life, and he found
himself shaken to the very depths of his being, but
he came forth conqueror. He loved the girl with all
the power of an intense nature, but he would never
seek to bind her. His love should bless her but never
prove a scourge. The girl’s heart had grown faint
when it had caught his meaning. Love, sweet, pure
soul-redeeming love, had come to her, but not such
as the world knew it. She was not to know the
meaning of the word wife. O, how her love had been
tested! But love had conquered, and together they
had studied the problem that had at first appeared
as though it would prove the shoal upon which their
bark of life was to be wrecked. But the skillful
hands of reason had warded off the dreaded disaster
and had safely guided them through the rocks out
into the smooth waters of the mid ocean, but for the
present they were adrift; as yet they could not see
the shore, the haven where they might safely be
anchored. Now and then this caused the trusting
maiden an anxious pang, the honorable man a deeper
pain than he wished to betray, but the sky was clear,
bright sunshine and smooth waters made the way
very pleasant. So they were content to drift on.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Margaret had learned to understand the meaning
of the glorious freedom that her lover sought to
secure to her. She had looked deep into the mysteries
of married life with the aid of that mother
whose experiences had been so terrible. She had
learned also to walk with open eyes and to read the
signs as she walked. And oh, how her pure soul
revolted at the hideous sights that were covered with
a filmy veil, sights that the gauze like covering made
only the more horrible by the vain attempt at concealment.</p>

<p class='c005'>She lifted the smiling blue eyes to the clouded
face of her friend who seemed almost to have forgotten
her presence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Imelda, what do you think? Do you
now understand how I could express myself as I did
some days ago?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I understand now, as I did then, that you had
just cause to mistrust the present institution of marriage.
I do not blame you, but there is still much
that is not clear to me. What else can we do, if we
would not sacrifice nature’s truest, purest instincts?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret slowly shook her head, and scarcely
above a whisper came the words:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Wilbur had been observing the girls and had
heard the low-spoken words. A sad smile played
about his lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wait,” he gently said. “The problem is too
great to be solved in one short afternoon. It has
caused me considerable thought for quite a number
of years. As yet I have found no satisfactory solution,
but do not despair of eventually doing so.
When woman becomes conscious of her true worth
she will soon find means to have that worth recognized.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>I think, however, for a first lesson, Miss
Ellwood has done extremely well. Suppose we discuss
some commonplace subject for a change. The
weather for instance. Have we not been having
some very fine weather for October?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Both girls looked up, first at Wilbur, then at
each other. There was nothing remarkable about
discussing the weather, but just at this moment it
sounded ridiculous, and but for the fact that Wilbur’s
face was like an impenetrable mask they would have
burst out laughing. As it was they controlled the
desire and soon found themselves discussing plays,
literature, art, etc., which they found very interesting.</p>

<p class='c005'>The minutes passed by and soon they arrived at
their destination. The parting words were said,
Wilbur giving expression to the sincere wish that
she would again join their circle.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Imelda did join them, again and again. She
seemed drawn to the circle in the lecture room by
some magic force. Question after question on that
radical platform was brought up for discussion. The
fields of science also were explored. She soon found
that she was able to learn at that place more in a
few short months than in all probability she would
have learned in the outside world in years.</p>

<p class='c005'>Many were the battles she was called upon to
fight with the deep rooted superstitions of other days.
Idol after idol crumbled to dust beneath the merciless
fingers, but bravely she held out while scale after
scale fell from the weak eyes until at last they grew
stronger and she could see as with a new light.
Bright and clear was now what had seemed dark and
murky before. The new truths burst upon her in all
their splendor and at last Imelda was ready to take
her place in the world as an inspired priestess of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>new realm of thought; of the new truths by means
of which the world should be renovated and womankind
uplifted.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus time had slipped by and brought its changes
to Imelda. Her mother had been laid to rest at her
father’s side, and in spite of the desire of her friends
to share their home, she had made one for herself.
Humble though her little attic room might be she
was queen in its realm.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were indeed dark days that now fell to the
lot of Imelda. It was hard to hide the aching heart
beneath a smiling exterior, but it was part of her
daily task, and bravely did she accomplish it. But
when she returned at night to spend the evening alone
in her little room, it was then that she was often overcome;
it was then that the over tired spirit gave way
to grief. As she looked around at the many little
mementoes of earlier and happier days, they brought
vividly to her memory the times when her father,
with his favorite child at his side, had permitted her
to look into the depths of his artist soul. If home
had not always been the most pleasant of places, yet
at those times she had not known the meaning of the
word sorrow as she now knew it. Father and mother
were now sleeping in the silent grave. The brother
and sister who ought, by nature’s ties, to be more
closely drawn to her now than ever before, were, she
knew not where. And in the new light in which she
now looked upon the world, she felt more sorrow
than anger toward the wayward absent ones. O, if
she could but have the assurance that the future
would develop the better part of their natures she
felt she could willingly forget the past. Could she
but find them! She thought that perhaps there
might yet be a way of reaching their hearts; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>never a word did she hear from either. If it had not
been for the friendship of Margaret, who was more
and more a true sister to her, her life would indeed
have been lonely and dark.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nor was Margaret her only friend. Among the
circle of radicals where Imelda was a constant attendant
she found many that were sympathetic in more
ways than one, but none attracted her more powerfully
than did Mr. Roland. He was more like a
father than a mere friend, and fatherly had often
been the advice that the kind and sympathetic old
gentleman had given her. One other, also, had an
influence over her life and strongly did she feel herself
attracted in this direction. That other was Wilbur
Wallace. In spite of the love he bore the winsome
Margaret, the sad dark-eyed Imelda had the
power to stir his heart to its very depths. Fain
would he have folded both sweet girls to his great
loving heart and cherished them there as priceless
treasures. Margaret saw and understood what was
going on in the heart of the man she loved, but she
understood also that that which was “her own”
would remain her own, and she “feared not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret was right. Even though Imelda’s
head was sometimes pillowed on the breast of her
lover and even though he should kiss the tears from
the sad eyes and hush the fear of the trembling lips,
what of it? The love that was to throw Imelda’s
whole being into a tumult was yet to be called forth
by another. This love that she felt for Wilbur Wallace
was a sweet, tranquil affection, undisturbed by
the passions that clamor for possession. Knowing
and understanding this, the two girls were more firm
friends than ever. If now and then Wilbur felt a
stronger emotion; an emotion that would cost him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>an effort to subdue, no one but himself was aware of
it. He knew that the time had not as yet come that
it would be practicable to give vent to his feelings in
the manner that he felt was right and natural, and
that the well being and happiness of both these girls
was far too dear to his noble heart for him to cause
them one needless pang.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus matters stood when one day Margaret
startled them by stating her determination to prepare
to go upon the stage. She knew that she
possessed dramatic talent of no mean order, and had
often expressed a desire to choose the stage as a
means of earning a livelihood. Nor did she meet
with opposition now from her friends, although they
were at first somewhat taken aback. Within a week
she was in the hands of a competent teacher. This,
of course, necessitated study, and instead of spending
so many of her evenings as she had hitherto done in
the society of Wilbur and Imelda, she was forced to
devote her spare time to books. This fact caused
Imelda and Wilbur to be more often thrown together
than ever before. Now it was music they practiced
together; then it was a new book they read and discussed,
while now and then they would go and hear
some good opera. As a general thing when such
was the case Margaret would go also, as she passionately
loved the queens of song; and her sweet lips
only curved in a happy smile as she observed the
good understanding between the two whom she so
dearly loved. That such a thing could be possible as
Imelda winning her lover from her never once
entered Margaret’s mind. And she was right. Wilbur
Wallace did not hold lightly the gift of his Margaret’s
love.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Thus matters went on. The cruel, piercing
winter months had waned; balmy spring with her
flattering promises had again visited the land, and
in turn was now giving place to the sultry days of
summer. The tired shop girls, behind their counters,
looked as though they could barely drag their weary
limbs along. Imelda had for some time felt as
though she could not possibly hold out much longer
when, near the close of an unusually hot and close
June day, a lady, small of figure and dressed in the
airiest of summer costumes, came tripping down the
aisle and stopping just in front of Imelda’s counter
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some real laces, please.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With a start and smothered cry of “Alice!”
Imelda went forward and the little lady caught the
stately head and drew it down, imprinting the warmest
of kisses upon the pale lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Still in the old place? I thought I would find
you here, providing you had not done as I did—got
married and settled down as the queen of some fair
home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A silvery laugh dropped from the cherry lips,
but the laugh sounded just the least bit forced, and
the bright glow on the rounded cheek,—was it really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the flush of perfect happiness? Imelda looked long
and carefully into the blue eyes, but though they
were clear she could not read within their depths, the
dimpling smile hid everything, if there was anything
to hide.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, where did you get your cranky ideas?
O, I forget,—you still live in Chicago, which city,
as I believe, has known many changes, and, I suppose,
the people who inhabit the dear old place must
of course change with it. But Harrisburg is a
rather conservative town, you know, and radical or
progressive ideas are not much indulged in by its
people. How is it? am I right? have you been imbibing
some of these new foolish notions?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda smiled. This little chatterbox was rattling
on at a great rate, on a subject she evidently
knew little about, and had already exhausted her
store of knowledge. What would she think if she
knew exactly what Imelda’s views at present were?
The girl behind the counter had an idea that her
visitor would be somewhat shocked. So she only
answered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe I have, it is in the air, you know, like
a contagious disease.” Alice laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it dangerous?” she asked, but not waiting
for a reply she continued:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you time? I would like to have you
with me this evening so that we could enjoy a quiet
dinner together. May I call for you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A flush stole over the pale face. When had such
a pleasure ever been offered her? For a moment she
hesitated, then threw scruples to the winds.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; you may come. I will be ready. This
is indeed kind of you to make me such an offer, and
I assure you I shall appreciate it.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>The dainty gloved hand was raised in a mock
threatening manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you speak again in that strain I shall punish
you by failing to put in an appearance. But I must
not forget—your address, please.” Imelda wrote
name of street and number on a slip of paper and
Alice Westcot tripped down the aisle and out to
where her carriage was in waiting. Imelda’s lips
quivered as she watched the friend of former days
pass out.</p>

<p class='c005'>There were but few of the girls in the store now
who had known Alice. The few who had seen the
meeting between the two wondered who the richly
attired lady could be who was on intimate terms with
the sad faced but well liked companion and co-worker
who had a smile and kind word for all but who made
friends with none—none except the jolly, mirth-loving
but proud Margaret Leland.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda sighed as the form of Alice disappeared.
Who would have thought, looking at the dainty
figure, that in former years she had stood at the self-same
counter where Imelda now presided. That she
had wealth at her command was easy to be seen. But
was she happy? If she was not she knew well how
to hide it. No casual observer would have noticed
anything wrong and when her carriage in the evening
drove up to the number that Imelda had given
her the pretty figure was robed in daintiest white.
When Imelda appeared in the doorway in her plain
black lawn and simple sailor hat she hesitated a
moment. She knew she would look out of place at
the side of this richly attired lady, and she would
rather not go. But already Alice was calling to her
to come. “For,” she said, “we want a good long
evening together and we cannot afford to waste time.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Imelda hesitated no longer. Why should she?
Did the possession of wealth alone make Alice Westcot
her superior? She told herself, No! They had
been friends in the days of long ago, Imelda had
found Alice a dear girl, sweet and pure and true, but
for all that she knew that mentally this little woman
was not her equal.</p>

<p class='c005'>So she took her place at Alice’s side without
further hesitation and they were soon whirling along
toward one of the beautiful parks. Imelda gave herself
up to the luxury of such delicious comfort, such
sense of pleasure as seldom came to her. Alice chattered
on at her side, telling her all about her life;
telling her of the many bright spots it contained; of
the beautiful home with its richly furnished rooms,
its charming grounds and surroundings; of the husband
who showered wealth upon her; of the two
pretty blossoms—her little daughters, one dark eyed
with glossy curls like the father and who was named
Meta, while the youngest was fair and flaxen-haired
like herself, and had been given the name of Norma.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda listened like one in a dream. Was Alice’s
life all sunshine? She made bold to ask her. For a
moment the bright sunny face clouded, then a silvery
laugh rippled from the ripe red lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not? Certainly it is sunshine, all sunshine.
Have I not everything my heart desires? No
more hard work, no more eking out and economizing,
no more planning how to make both ends meet.
My husband’s purse is open to me always. I have
nothing else to do but be happy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And then, not giving Imelda time to ask any
more questions, she in turn began to question her.
She poured such an avalanche of questions upon
her that Imelda did not know which to answer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>first. So bewildering was the torrent that Alice
was obliged to repeat them more slowly. Imelda
answered them all to the satisfaction of the persistent
questioner who gradually came in possession of all
the dark facts that had brought so much pain into
the young girl’s life and only at the close of the story
did she understand that Imelda was all alone and her
tender little heart swelled and two pearly drops fell
upon the hands of the girl as she lifted them and
pressed them to her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My poor, proud girl,” she said, “how you
must have suffered! Listen, Imelda. How would you
like to live with me? O, no!” she said as she looked
into the surprised eyes of the girl, and read therein a
refusal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I understand you too well to offer you a home
without a way of earning it. I understand your
proud nature better. But I would like someone
trustworthy to take care of my little daughters. For
really I am too much of a butterfly to have so grave
a charge on my hands without some one more competent
to aid me. I do not understand how to train
my babies. But you, who have had so much experience,
would know always what to do and they really
are such dear little darlings. I am sure you would
soon learn to love them and then you should be
treated as just the lady that you are, not as a servant
but as my own dear friend, and you should have
so much time all your own when you might read or
paint or study, and you shall cultivate that precious
talent of yours, music. Say yes, dear, you shall
never be sorry for it, I promise you,” and the little
cajoler wound her arm about the neck of the dumb-founded
girl and laid her face against hers and coaxed
and kissed and plead until Imelda gave the so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>desired promise. Then Alice was happy as a child
and said that Imelda must leave the store instantly
so she could prepare to go with her when she should
return to her home.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I expect to remain only a little over a week,
and until then you shall come and live with me at the
hotel where I am staying.” But to this Imelda would
not listen. It was all so sudden she could hardly
realize what it involved. A sharp pang entered her
heart as she thought of Margaret and Wilbur. Ah,
yes, it meant to give up these tried and trusted
friends. No! oh no, she could not leave without
devoting some of the last hours of her stay in the
dear old city that had always been her home, to the
friends whose lives were so closely woven in with
hers. She finally succeeded in making Alice understand
as much. In the morning when she told Margaret,
it seemed at first as though she could not comprehend
it. The large soft eyes filled with tears and
the sensitive lips quivered when the comprehension
came home to her, but she bravely choked a sob as
she said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are right. Why should you wear out
your life, standing day after day behind the counter
in that store, when opportunities are offered you
that do not fall to the lot of every working girl.
Yes, it is certainly my advice to accept this offer,
and make the most of it. But I insist that you spend
the evening with me at my mother’s home. We must
make the most of your short stay with us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda did not refuse. She felt it was not so
easy to sunder ties. She also felt a sadness steal
over her as she thought of how soon she was to turn
her back upon all the scenes of the old life, and some
very sharp pangs made themselves manifest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The evening found her with her friends. After
supper Wilbur came and was told of the projected
change. He bent a quick searching glance upon
Imelda and in the eyes that met his he thought he
read a subdued pain. All through that evening
Imelda was unusually quiet. Wilbur and Margaret
played and sang but Imelda only listened. Mrs.
Leland once in passing behind her chair, laid her
hand upon the glossy dark hair, slightly bending the
head so she could look into the dark eyes, saying in a
low tone:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are the dreams of the future not bright, dear
Imelda? Don’t let the shadows of the past follow
you into the future. Keep a brave heart and it will
be strange if the future does not contain for you
something for which it is worth your while to work
and wait.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The dark eyes of the girl filled with a pearly mist.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, Mrs. Leland. When you, who
have certainly seen some of the very darkest sides of
life can still give such encouragement there must
indeed be a bright side to all things, only I am parting
with so much that is pleasant in the present, while
the future is yet a sealed book. Not knowing what
it may contain, it is not very wonderful that I should
feel the least bit sad.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“But you are to be an inmate of a beautiful
home and the companion of the friend of former
days.” Imelda smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, of former days, indeed. In the present
she is no longer all-sufficient. I have been walking
in the pathways of progress. She has been lingering
in those of blind faith, of contentment and of
duty. I fear there will be many lonely hours for
me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There may be,” said Mrs. Leland, “but also,
maybe, you can take this little girl by the hand and
lead her by your side. Who knows what your work
in this new life you are about to enter really may be?
So be of good cheer. At all events it is not to
another world, or even to another continent you are
going. You can send us your thought and your love
and receive a return in a few days. I know Margaret
and Wilbur will both expect a great many of the
white-winged messengers, and they will keep your
fingers busy in their spare moments.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She bent and kissed the warm lips of the girl
and passed out of the room, soon returning with a
basket of luscious fruit. For a time the music was
hushed while the fruit was discussed. But as all
things, the best as well as the worst, must come to an
end, so with Imelda’s visit to her dearly cherished
friends. As the evening was far advanced when
Imelda rose to go home, Margaret coaxed her to
remain with her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For I am,” she said, “so soon to lose you altogether,
that I want to make the most of the short
remaining time.” But Imelda was longing to be
alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not tonight, dear. Tonight you must excuse
me. I cannot help it, but I have so much to think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>about, so much to do yet. But tomorrow night, if
you wish I will come and remain with you,” and with
that Margaret had to be content. “Instead,” Imelda
went on, “I would have you come with me. It is
not so very late yet, and a walk will do you good.
Wilbur will make it doubly pleasant coming back.
What say you?” But now it was Margaret’s turn to
shake her head and say:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not tonight. But that does not mean that you
will be permitted to go home alone. Wilbur will
take care of you. Will you not?” Wilbur smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It seems I have nothing to say in the matter
but am quietly disposed of,” he said with a spice of
mischief, “the arrangement suits me, however, so I
will not object. Or, have you objections, little
girlie?” He looked at Imelda in such a quizzing
manner that the tell-tale blood dyed the pale cheeks
to a dark crimson.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you desire objections, Mr. Impudence, it
will not be a difficult matter to satisfy you.” Whereupon
the young man, in mock humility, begged her
not to deal with him too severely, plead for pardon,
and solemnly promised that he would not offend
again. Thus laughing and jesting they prepared to
part for the night. Ready to start Imelda stood
some moments at the door gazing up into the starlit
heavens. Wilbur in the meantime wound his arm
tenderly about his beloved Margaret. For a moment
she was enfolded in a close embrace; pressed
to his manly breast, his lips closed over hers in a
tender clinging kiss. “My own precious one,” he
murmured,—“you love me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As my life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again their lips met, then he stepped forward to
Imelda’s side and together they walked toward the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>humble home of the girl. For awhile neither spoke,
and when at last their voices did find utterance it was
only to speak of commonplace matters. Their hearts
were too full to converse much; least of all of that
which was uppermost in their minds. Imelda’s leaving
would make a great change for them all, and
Wilbur felt that it would make a decided change in
his life. He almost feared to give expression to his
feelings,—certainly not under the starlit heavens.
So, when after a quiet walk through the nearly silent
streets, they reached the home which soon would
know Imelda no longer, he stopped, loth to leave
her, and she, as if divining his thought, simply said,
“Come,” and just as simply he followed her up the
three flights of stairs into the little room where he
threw himself into an arm chair at the open window.
Imelda was about to strike a light when he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t, please; come and sit here with me. It
is easier to talk with only the light of the moon.”
And Imelda did as he requested, moving her chair so
that she sat just opposite him, but for awhile it
seemed that the moon, which was full and flooded the
city with its pale silvery glory, was not going to
prove an inspiration to conversation, for the moments
slipped by until half an hour had passed, and
as yet neither had spoken. But now Wilbur turned
and laid his hand gently upon that of the dreaming
girl.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Imelda!” Low, soft, tremulous, the name
dropped from his lips. She started. Why was it
that the mere sound of her name should thrill her so?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Imelda!” Again the low-spoken name came
to her ear like sweet, thrilling music, and suddenly,
ere she knew how it had happened, she found herself
encircled by two strong arms, her head pillowed upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the heaving breast, and the bearded lips pressed
close to hers in a burning kiss. Tender words and
endearing names greeted her ear.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, my darling, it is hard to see you go, not
knowing when, if ever, I may see you again, and just
as you were becoming so dear to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But Margaret?” came in a trembling whisper
from Imelda’s quivering lips. He held her closer
still as he made answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is the dearest, sweetest woman that ever
loved a man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But she trusts you,” came from the trembling lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And why should she not? Am I not trustworthy?
Darling, she knows the love I bear her is
all her own, and surely, you do not think her so
small that she should deem it necessary in order to
hold her own, my heart must be held in such narrow
confines that none other, though she be equally pure,
equally good, may find room therein? You do not
think that, do you? No, my love; Margaret is too
true, too noble a woman to fail to understand that no
matter how boundless the love may be Imelda has
won, it cannot detract one iota from that which is
hers in her own right. I could not love her less if I
would, notwithstanding the new love which you, my
darling, have won, and I cannot believe that Imelda
has been one of our number all this time without
having learned to understand that there is nothing so
pure as the love that is free, free to bring blessings
upon the object that inspires that love. Love is
limitless. Each new object that finds its way to the
innermost recesses of a true lover’s heart brings new
stimulus that each in term may reap the benefits, the
added blessings that are bound to come with the calling
into life of each new love.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Wilbur Wallace was laying his whole soul bare
before the pure eyes of the young girl, and O, what
a storm of emotions swept over her soul! What a
new import, and how different, these words conveyed
from the standards that had been taught her from her
earliest infancy. A little over a year ago she would
have believed it to be rank treason to passively listen,
with such a sweet sense of enjoyment stealing
through her veins, to such passionate words of love
from Wilbur’s lips,—and now? Well! try as she
would, she could not detect a feeling of guilt. On
the contrary she was conscious of being very happy
at that precise moment, and the conviction that had
for some time been making itself manifest,—that it
is right to love, and to enjoy that love, whenever and
wherever Cupid may make his appearance, was
forcing itself more clearly upon her mind. She now
began to believe and understand that nature is right.
That love must always be right, and so her answer
to Wilbur was only to nestle closer to his side.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not the first time that he had encircled
her waist with his arms, and kissed the ripe dewy
lips. She had always permitted it, smiling like a
happy child, as she looked into the pure dark eyes
above her. Often he had drawn both fair girls to
him, an arm about each slender waist, a fair and
a dark head resting upon either shoulder. Margaret
never thought that Imelda was robbing her, and into
Imelda’s head the idea never entered that such proceedings
were not right, although he had never
folded her quite so closely, nor pressed her lips so
firmly as he had done tonight, and now she felt he was
giving expression to more than the friendship he had
hitherto tendered her. With a mighty bound her
heart told her that Wilbur loved her! And Imelda?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>O well, she was a woman! and as far as we have
known her we have every reason to pronounce her a
true woman, true to all of nature’s holiest instincts.
So, who would or who could blame her when she gave
herself up to the subtle warmth that had crept into
her heart and pervaded her whole being? She felt
her pulses throb and thrill, and knew she was under
the influence of the sweetest of all human emotions,
but feeling them to be pure she gave herself up to
the influence of the hour, and to the love that had
unawares crept into her life.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yes! Imelda now knew that she loved, even as
she was loved, and the minutes passed until they
grew to hours—hours of pure holy joy, and when
Wilbur left her the dawn had crept into the east,
and with his kisses resting upon her lips she still sat
at the open window, dreaming of the raptures that
life—sweetened by magic love—had brought her.
And soon the waking dreams merged into the sleep
of youth and innocence as the brown eyes closed;
and still the smile hovered about the dewy red lips
as they in tender cadence whispered—“Wilbur!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The morning hours passed. The sun rose high
in the heavens and still Imelda slept; slept until the
noonday rays fell across the fair flushed face. The
heat soon made the room uncomfortably warm,
waking the sleeping maiden who, confused at first,
did not understand how she came to be sleeping at
the open window. But all in a moment memory
returning with a swift rush, brought back the sweet
hours of the departed night. The red life blood
stained the fair cheek and obeying the first impulse
Imelda’s face was buried in her hands, hiding the
blushes that stained it. Such holy memories she
would keep hidden even from the sun’s bright rays.
Then brushing the tangled tresses from her brow she
cooled the burning face with fresh cold water, darkened
her room and disrobing lay down upon her bed
to rest the aching limbs that had become cramped by
reclining so long in an uncomfortable position.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the desire to sleep had fled. Thoughts in
the brown head revolved in chaotic confusion. The
sweet love dream wove rosy fancies until chased by
the more realistic thoughts of the near future, causing
a feeling of sadness until rose-hued love again
conquered.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Thus for an hour or more, in sweet reveries
indulging, and when the excited nerves were becoming
soothed, and soft slumber gently closing the
drowsy eyes, a low rap sounded upon the door.
The next minute Margaret was sitting upon the edge
of the bed, chaffing and teasing Imelda for being so
lazy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is easy to be seen,” she was saying, “that
you were born for something better than standing
behind a counter, measuring laces. What a perfect
lady you would make, to be sure. Your very first
holiday you must use in practicing the airs, the manners
of a fine lady.” Her clear sweet laugh rang out
while she bent and kissed the red lips of her friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda’s soft rounded arms wound themselves
about the fair form bending above her and drew
her close to her fast beating heart. Laying her lips
to Margaret’s pink shell-like ears, she rapidly whispered;
then drawing back, eagerly did she look into
the now quiet and pretty sobered face of Margaret,
who seemed to have sunk into deep thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Margaret,” whispered Imelda. “Margaret
what have you to say?” The large blue eyes rested
lovingly on the dark face before her, darker hued
still because of the burning blushes that were
mantling it. Margaret’s answer was to bend low
and lay her face close to hers. Her eyes shone
brightly as she clasped Imelda to her breast.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What have I to say? Why, as you followed
the dictates of your heart you have done perfectly
right. Wilbur is so grand so noble a man, how can
a woman help loving him? You did not think I
would find fault with you for doing precisely as I
have done? Maybe, if I thought it were possible
that you could win him away from me it might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>that I would not treat the matter so coolly,” [a new
light dawned in Margaret’s eyes] “for I am only
human, and I love him, O, how I love him! I find in
him my nearest realization of heaven—as I can think
it. He is to me life itself. If the star of my love
were suddenly to set I think my life would go out
with it. My love has power to sway me like a storm-tossed
bark, like a mighty oak in the wind. And
you, Imelda? Tell me what is your love like.” The
waves of rich blood were flooding the face of the
questioned girl.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not like that,” she said. “Mine is a quiet
joy; it is peace; it is balm. Like oil on troubled
waters; a calm after a storm; a haven of rest. To
lose him would bring me pain, deep and lasting, but
not a complete wreck. But O, Margaret, I don’t
want to think of anything like that. The mere
thought hurts.”</p>

<p class='c005'>How long the girls would have gone on in this
strain can never be known, for at this moment a rap
again resounded on the door of the room. Imelda,
frightened, quickly drew the covers closely about
her form, the next moment she was merrily joining
in the silvery laugh of Alice who had entered without
waiting to be bidden. The dainty figure was
attired in rich black lace that became the lily fairness
of the sweet face exceedingly well. It was the first
meeting between Margaret and Alice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A pretty, merry child,” was Margaret’s inward
comment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Proud and haughty,” was Alice’s first thought.
That was always the first impression Margaret made
on others, and only in the measure that new acquaintances
won their way into her heart did she unbend;
only to the nearest and dearest did she show the child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of nature that she really was. It was not long, however,
until winsome, pretty Alice had found that way,
and for a while Margaret dropped the proud air that
became her so well and descended to the mimic and
burlesque. She recited selections of emotions and
passion, until tears filled the eyes of her auditors,
then suddenly, in the twinkling of an eye, the broad
brogue of Irish Bridget caused them, with blinded
eyes, to hold their sides, convulsed with laughter.
Then followed a negro song, ending with an Indian
war-whoop; whereupon she sat down upon the floor
at their feet and asked them if they did not think it
rather foolish to so exert themselves with laughing,
such a warm day. “It is so exhausting, you know,
and so vulgar!” and waving her fan back and forward
in the most approved languid, lady-like style,
she elevated her slightly retrousse nose, while her
companions went into new convulsions of laughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leaving them to recover their composure she
rose and stepping to the window drew aside the curtains.
In a moment she was lost to her surroundings;
her thoughts following her eyes into the distance,
into the future. Incomprehensible dreamer she was,
as she gazed up into the azure sky. The pearly teeth
sank deep into the crimson lips. Tightly the white
slender hands were interlaced, while the large eyes
became soft and lustrous, a mist rising therein, and
presently tears were falling upon the folded hands,
recalling her from dreamland to the realistic present.
Just then Imelda’s arm was wound about the snowy
neck and her quick eye caught sight of the tear drops.
Her heart gave a quick apprehensive bound.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it?” grasped the paling lips as she
caught the tear-bedewed hands in hers. “Am I the
cause?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>But already Margaret’s mood had changed; a
bright smile played about the sensitive mouth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, dearest,” she said, “how could you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Imelda was not so easily satisfied. The
cruel fear entered her heart that Wilbur might be
the cause. The painful thought was reflected in her
eyes. All in an instant Margaret understood. Folding
her arms about her friend’s neck she said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not that, Imelda, never that! I am not so
foolish, but I do not understand myself today. It is
a day of my many moods. I am as changeful as an
April day. I was thinking of the future, what it
may bring me. Do not think, silly child, that your
pure love for Wilbur has caused my tears. Not of
that was I thinking. Oh, the curse of poverty! I
love beautiful things. I love fame. I love wealth.
I love a home, and I love little children. [This last
came almost in a whisper.] What will, oh what will
the future bring? Any of these? and which of these?
will any of my dreams be realized? Sometimes a
sort of despair comes over me when I think of the
hours of trial, of pain, of suffering my dear mother
has been compelled to endure, with her nature so
well fitted to enjoy and to bless. A kind of wild
anger sometimes takes possession of me. It has been
nothing but plod and work. Then I think if her fate
is to be mine, over again, I could curse the day I was
born.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But those feelings do not often last long. The
determination to conquer buoys me up. I mean to
sway the world, and—I will! I will fight for freedom
until I obtain it. I will not permit myself to be
shackled and fettered. Society has placed fetters
enough upon me at my birth; and I will not add to
their number. Free as the wild winds I mean to be.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>I will conquer fate. The day shall dawn that victory
shall be mine; and then those I love shall be happy
as the laughing sunshine of a summer’s day.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And to curb some one else!—to curb you, my
sweet Imelda, could I do that and be consistent with
my ideas of justice? Never again, my dear girl,
never again insult me with that suspicion. Now
good bye, my precious one, this evening I expect
you to be with me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Bending she kissed her, and without bestowing
a single glance upon the surprised Alice, Margaret
was gone ere Imelda had fully comprehended her
meaning.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Imelda had seen Margaret in similar moods before,
and she knew of the intensity that sometimes
lurked beneath the smiling exterior. She knew
Margaret’s most dearly cherished desire was some
day to be a mother. To press the rosy dimpled infant,
the child of the man her heart owned king—to
her jubilant heart was her dream of dreams. But
with this gift that she so craved she demanded no
common conditions and environments. To call into
being a perfect child she must be a perfect mother,
and she understood, only too well, that she could not
be that, surrounded with imperfect conditions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Something had vividly portrayed this dream before
her eyes today. Imelda understood the fierce
storm of emotions that sometimes shook the nature
of the proud girl to its very foundations. But Alice
did not understand. She was rather frightened than
otherwise at the storm that had so suddenly burst
from the lips that had but a short time previously
been overflowing with gayest merriment. The
depths of feelings thus exhibited was a revelation to
her. She had never heard such wild, such passionate
words from any one, much less from the lips of a
woman. In a helpless manner she turned to Imelda
for explanation. But Imelda appeared to have forgotten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the presence of Alice, as she sat blankly staring
after the receding form and at the door through
which she had passed, and only after Alice had twice
spoken her name was she recalled to herself. With
a deep heart-felt sigh she arose and began arranging
her simple toilet, but never a word did she say of the
queer manner of her friend, until again the voice of
Alice aroused her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was it you said? O, the meaning of this
strange outburst. I don’t know if I would be able
to explain the moods of Margaret. I doubt if anyone
could explain them, but she is the dearest,
sweetest, noblest woman that ever lived. Her life,
like mine, has been overshadowed by those of her
parents. She understands the meaning of the finger
of scorn, and her proud spirit rebels against it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The finger of scorn? What do you mean?
Explain yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Margaret’s mother is a divorced woman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A divorced woman!” broke, in a surprised
cry, from the lips of the young woman. Another
question seemed to hover on them, but checking
herself she waited an answer. Imelda smiled. She
understood what was going on in the other’s mind.
When, in all the past, had a woman gone through the
dread ordeal of the divorce court that the world in
general and women in particular did not believe that
she was not in some way to blame for all the shame
that had been heaped upon her? She who had the
strength to dare to go through the calumny of the
divorce court was, in the minds of many, composed
of some grosser material than that was used in the
composition of women in general, and little Alice
Westcot was by no means above the common.</p>

<p class='c005'>How could she be? Had she ever been taught
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>otherwise? She had yet to learn that the divorced
woman, instead of being a coarse-grained creature of
the slums is more often possessed of a nature most
refined, and far superior to her surroundings. She
had yet to learn that it was for that very reason,
often, that the divorced woman bears the shame, the
disgrace and the calumny heaped upon her by the
cruel process of the law, in order to escape a state so
distasteful to her sensitive soul that death itself is
preferable to the continued endurance of bondage.
Imelda knowing this could only smile, but she hastened
to say:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes! her mother was married to a man that
Margaret is anything but proud to acknowledge as a
father. He was coarse and brutal; often descending
to so low a level as to strike the woman who was the
mother of his children. Margaret’s mother was a
woman very sensitive and refined. The only wonder
to me is that she ever could have made the selection
that she did, unless the fact that she was little more
than a child could be considered an explanation. He
drank, he cursed her, he struck her. He did not
provide. The more she worked the less did he do,
and the more he depended upon her efforts to gain a
livelihood, until finally one day she took her babes
(she had two of them) in her arms and left the man
who had made of her life such a miserable ruin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As time passed he sought to induce her, by
every effort in his power, to return to him; but his
efforts were unavailing. She would rather, she says,
have thrown herself with a babe clasped in either
arm into the cold waves of the darkly flowing river
than again return to the bondage from which she had
escaped. For, added to all the other indignities she
had been forced to bear, were the constant outrages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>perpetrated upon her womanhood, and which she
could no longer endure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The brute!” broke, in a passionate exclamation,
from the lips of Alice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not heeding the interruption, save by a quick
sharp glance at the young woman by which glance
she noticed that her lips were compressed and the
delicate hand clinched, she proceeded with her story.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Finding her mother could not be induced to
return he finally entered a suit for divorce, and here
the demon nature of the man showed itself in its most
depraved form. It would have been the easiest thing
in the world to have obtained a divorce upon the
grounds of desertion, as nothing could ever have induced
her to return to him, but that did not suit his
vile purpose. He circulated all the unclean, defaming
reports about her that his low mind could concoct,
which brought Mrs. Leland to the verge of
insanity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At last it was all over. Once more she was a
free woman, but defamed and disgraced before the
world. It was then she registered a vow that the
world should yet pay her the respect that was her
due, and nobly has she kept her word. Her daughter
Margaret can go with head erect into the best
society, while she herself is everywhere treated with
the most marked respect. But for all that, Margaret
has oft times felt the stigma her father has placed
upon her mother, and through her upon her own
name, and many of these fierce outbursts,—one of
which you have just witnessed, are due to that fact.
But Margaret, like her mother, is pure gold, and no
taint remains upon her, or upon her equally true and
pure mother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As Imelda finished speaking she finished also her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>toilet, and sinking into a low rocker, in a tired manner,
laid her head against its back. Presently Alice
slipped forward and knelt at her side. She laid her
face against Imelda’s knees but said nothing. For a
few moments the young girl permitted her to retain
this position, then laying her hand upon the fair
head and gently brushing the blond hair from the
white temples, said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Alice?” A change had come over
the merry features. A hitherto unthought-of sadness
dwelt in the light eyes where also a suspicious
moisture was visible, and with a noticeable effort she
conquered something that was gathering in her
throat.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing,” she replied. “What should I have
to say? Only Mrs. Leland’s history has placed a
new light upon divorce in my eyes. I have never
heard a case thus discussed, or seen it placed in such
light before. She was at all events a brave woman,
and I would like to meet her. As for Margaret I
know I shall always love her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you really wish to meet Mrs. Leland nothing
will be easier,” Imelda said. “I am to spend the
evening with them. You can accompany me and
judge for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you. But you must remember, Margaret
has not invited me. So you see I cannot go.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense! I see nothing of the kind. Margaret
is not responsible for the oversight she has
committed and I will take it upon myself to introduce
you into their pretty but simple home. But really,
I feel hungry. I have not taken food today, and my
stomach demands its rights.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not taken food today? Why, Imelda! what
do you mean? Do you know what time it is?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“I must confess that I have not been troubling
myself to ascertain, so cannot answer your question.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, you seem to attach little importance to
the craving of the inner man—or woman, which is it
in this case?” laughed Alice. “But for all that, will
answer my question myself for the enlightenment of
your pitiful ignorance. It is now half past two. I
am usually not any too early a riser myself but long
ere this I generally have eaten my second meal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Little gourmand!” smiled Imelda. “I wonder
you do not say it is time for a third one.” Alice
laughed lightly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is a libel,” she said. “I protest; but in
order that you may be no longer exposed to the
danger of starving yourself I insist that you now go
with me. I will take care of you in the most approved
style.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda protested. “A glass of milk, some fruit
and a piece of cake, will be all-sufficient and I have a
supply of that on hand.” But Alice insisted so
strenuously that Imelda succumbed and in a short
time both were comfortably seated at a table in a
restaurant awaiting the dainty viands that Alice had
ordered notwithstanding the protesting looks of
Imelda. But Alice only laughingly shook her head
and proceeded to call for some little extras. It
seemed to afford her a peculiar pleasure to press these
little attentions. She was happy to be able to contribute
towards furnishing some little pleasure for
the friend for whom she knew life had hitherto not
turned the sunniest side, and Imelda soon came to
understand that it was useless to protest against her
friend’s generosity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Having finished their meal they seated themselves
in the carriage that stood in waiting, and were soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>bowling along the shady drives. For awhile thought
was busy with each of the fair occupants. Imelda
was thinking of the changes that had come into her
life, past and present. How many sighs, how many
tears lay in the bitter past. She shuddered as with
cold, on this blazing hot day. No, no! She was
done with it. She did not desire to resurrect its
skeleton memories, even though some dearly loved
ones belonged to that past. But the present? Were
not the changes the present was bringing also fraught
with bitterness? Yes, but not without hope. The
green banner of hope was held high, indicating the
coming of better times. There would be sweet
memories mixed with the pain of parting. And the
future? She would win it, she would conquer it.
She would not be less brave than Margaret who so
earnestly vowed to conquer all obstructions.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>While such thoughts surged through the brain
of Imelda, what was it that clouded the brow of fair
Alice, causing now and then the ruby lips to part
with a tremulous sigh? What caused the eyes to
grow dim, the child-like mouth to quiver? Was
there a skeleton in her closet also? Ah, could we
always but lift the veil and look underneath! What
aching, breaking hearts the smiling lips sometimes
mask. Imelda looked up just in time to see a bright
drop splashing upon the dainty gloved hand, but
which was hastily brushed away. Another moment
and the young woman was laughing and chatting in
a way that showed a light and merry (?) heart underneath,
and Imelda forbore to question. The two
had a very nice drive, enjoying the parks and open
air sports. The hours of rest were doing Imelda a
world of good, reviving her spirits and calling a rosy
hue to the pale face.</p>

<p class='c005'>The evening found them at the home of the
Lelands, where they were both heartily welcomed.
Alice watched the faces about her, wondering whose
lover the handsome Wilbur Wallace was. She read
in his face an almost worshipful love when his eyes
rested on the proudly regal Margaret, while they followed
with a passionate intensity every movement of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the queenly Imelda, which glance would soften to a
holy glow when he bent his head above her and when
his hand touched hers. Alice felt the warmth of
Mrs. Leland’s motherly manner, and soon found that
her heart was in every word she uttered. Although
here and there a silver thread could be seen among
the brown, her manner was as bright and youthful
as that of the young girl’s. Later the generous hostess
brought in fruits, cake and cream, and merry
sallies were passed round, while the refreshments
were being discussed. Music and singing came in
also for their share, and Alice felt that she had passed
a very pleasant evening indeed.</p>

<p class='c005'>The absence of all formality was not the least
pleasing feature. The naturalness of every movement
and action was refreshing in the extreme to
Alice, whom the wealth of her husband had led, during
the years of her married life, into those circles of
society where empty phrases and society small talk
are paramount, but which must be delivered in a
stiff, formal, cut and dried manner. To talk, to act,
to laugh, to eat, to drink, to sleep, to rule—that is
society life; anything but to be natural. O, how
homelike the little circle was! The evening passed
by and the time came for parting. Margaret reminded
Imelda of her promise of yesternight, and
tendered the same invitation to Alice, but the latter
did not accept.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No! no! I would only be intruding. It is
enough that I am about to separate these precious
friends without intruding upon the last days and
hours they can have together. With many thanks
for the pleasant evening I have spent I will bid you
good night. Tomorrow is another day when I shall
see you again.” Leaning back in the cushions of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>carriage she was rapidly driven to her hotel. Wilbur
kissed both fair girls and for a moment his arms
wound about Imelda’s form. She could feel the
beating of his heart and heard his rapid breathing.
She smiled into his face, wound her arms about his
neck, laid her cheek against his, for an instant
touched her lips to his whispered “Good night,” and
the next instant had slipped from his embrace, and
from the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret was standing at the window gazing at
the starry heavens when she heard the door close
after Imelda’s retreating form. Turning she saw
that they two were alone. Again she turned to the
window giving him time to recover himself, and when
a few minutes later she crossed the room to his side
Wilbur had regained his composure. She laid both
hands upon his shoulder and looked into the dark
eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wilbur,” she whispered. Only that one word,
the mention of his name, but O, it spoke volumes.
The next moment he had caught her to his breast and
covered the fair face with kisses.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My darling! my darling!” he said. “You
love me, you trust me?” There was a suspicious
moisture in the dark blue eyes as she crept closer into
his arms.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know I do.” The girl’s heart was passing
through a fiery ordeal. Would she prove pure gold?
Long were they locked in each other’s embrace, not
a word was spoken, but the lips were sealed each
with the vibrating glowing lips of the other. Holding
her thus close he drew her to his knee as he sank
into the swelling cushions of an arm chair, and
Imelda’s dark head had for several hours pressed the
snowy pillow ere Margaret sought her side. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>leaned over and kissed her on the forehead when the
white lids opened and the soft arms closed about the
neck of her friend. Thus the two clasped in each
other’s arms a dark head and a fair one pressing the
same pillow, their breath mingling, they fell asleep,
and not until Mrs. Leland gently shook them and
laughingly called them the seven sleepers, did they
awake.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am afraid you would be ‘my ladies’ of the
first water could you live according to your inclination.
I believe girls are naturally lazy.” Thus teasing
and laughing she moved about opening the shutters
and letting in the bright sunshine.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only see how you have let the golden hours of
the morning fly away lazily hugging your bed.”
But the smiling faces on the pillow did not look as
though this moralizing had anything to do with them.
Margaret saucily told her mother that she (her
mother) was only sorry that she could not lie there
at that hour and enjoy a lazy nap, but if she would
be kind enough to cease moving about and give them
a little chance they would think the matter over, and
in a little while come downstairs and have some
breakfast.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Which means, you saucebox, that I am to
leave the room and go to prepare your breakfast.
Very well, Miss Indolence, but I hope you will condescend
to make your appearance when it is prepared.”
Thus bright and cheerful the new day
began, and in a little while fresh and rosy, attired in
white muslin dresses they made their appearance.
Margaret had insisted that Imelda should wear one
of her own snowy robes for the morning.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am tired of seeing you in this everlasting
black.” So the somber gown had been laid aside and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>when later in the day Alice came to carry Imelda off
she clapped her little hands in delight at the sight of
the spotless robes. She wanted her to retain the
pretty dress for the day, but to this Imelda would
not consent, so she had her way. Then Alice asked
Margaret to join them for the day. “I shall need
your advice and help.” Both girls looked up
with a questioning glance, but Alice shook her head
and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“No! I will answer no questions, only come.”
They were not long in doubt, however, as to what it
was that Alice wanted Margaret’s advice for. They
drove up to a large dress goods emporium where they
selected a variety of beautiful fabrics. Soft gray
woolens and dainty white muslins; also a handsome
black silk. At first Imelda did not understand that
they were meant for her; and when she realized it;
it was too late to protest. She was scarcely more
than half pleased, as Alice counted out the price for
the pretty material, and made up her mind to accept
it only as a loan, and so she told Alice. Alice did
not object, only said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are many things you will need and it
will not be a question of how soon you will return
the amount; that can be settled some day when you
leave me. I would far rather, however, have made
you a present of these few necessary articles.”
Imelda flushed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you do not wish to offend me, you will cease
to speak in such a strain. I can understand that I
look very much out of place with my plain black
muslins, but as your companion, nursery governess
to your children I will hardly need much costly
apparel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As my friend,” corrected Alice. “Whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>else you may be; whatever position you may insist
upon filling, I wish it distinctly understood that you
are my friend. An orphan, in reduced circumstances,
if you will, but always, most assuredly my
friend.” Thus the matter was settled for the present.
Imelda bit her lip. Alice did not understand that
the act of kindness, as she meant it to be, was, and
must be most galling to the proud spirited girl; but
no further comments were made at that time. The
fair trio with their purchases next drove to a dressmaking
establishment. Under protest Imelda was
measured, and the order given to have the dresses
made on short notice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have nothing to say in this, only to obey,”
Alice had said with merry laughter. Thus the days
slipped by one after another, until Imelda’s trunks
were packed, awaiting the expressman to take them
to the depot. She herself was arrayed in her traveling
dress, a plain soft gray serge, seated at the window
awaiting her friends who had promised to escort
her to the depot, Alice having said that she would
meet her there. Tears stood in her eyes as she let
them wander over the familiar objects that she was
to take leave of now forever. Many a little trifle
was stored away in the bottom of her trunks, but
other and larger articles she was now forced to part
with. Many a token had been given to Margaret,
but there were still others that had to be disposed of,
which Wilbur had promised to do, and as she now
heard a familiar step coming up the stairs she quickly,
with a convulsive start, laid her hand upon her heart
and turned her face to the window. Another moment
an arm had drawn her into a close embrace and
she lay sobbing upon a manly breast.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Quite a while she lay thus, for the first time
giving full vent to her feelings. She had not intended
to do so, but of what avail are good resolutions
when the heart is full to overflowing; when
every fiber clings to some loved object from which it
is about to be separated, and she had not known how
close her heart had clung and was clinging to this
handsome, noble man, this lover of her best, her
almost only friend. In spite of all the teachings and
theorizing of later days the thought would steal into
her mind—was it right? Is it right? Was she, O,
was she wronging that noble girl? But Margaret’s
clear eyes still wore the same sweet, shining light
that they had always been wont to wear. Always
cheerful, always loving. If she considered herself
wronged she certainly understood how to most
successfully hide it.</p>

<p class='c005'>But in giving shape and being to such a thought,
was she not wronging Margaret? Her ideas of right
and wrong were far too lofty to permit her for one
instant to entertain such a sentiment. Would not
the idea that those precious friends by their love
were wronging her, be equivalent to placing a curb
upon the natural outpourings of their hearts? Would
not this thought be an infringement on personal liberty?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>To prove that she had been wronged Margaret
must analyze the how! Could it in this case be
otherwise than that some one person had taken or
appropriated something that was her own, her personal
property? Now how could any one rob her of
her own? She knew and felt that that which was
her own no one else could take from her, for just as
soon as that which she had thought her own was
appropriated by another, the unquestionable, the insurmountable
truth confronted her that the said
object had not been her own. Or, again, if such
could once have been the case it proved now her inability
to hold it and consequently at the same time
proved her unworthiness. Are we, is anyone, justified
in an attempt to forcibly retain that which in
nature is attracted elsewhere?</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret in her reasoning would have answered
“No!” Therefore it was the height of folly to
speak of robbing her. And when the object in question,
as in this case, was the heart of a man, was it
not a question so easily answered as not to leave a
shadow of doubt that he who bore the heart in question
in his bosom was the natural owner thereof, and
as such, was possessed of the indisputable right to
dispose of it?</p>

<p class='c005'>But Imelda, through his love for her, might
sway that heart? O, yes! that was her right, as he
had granted it to her. That another, equally pure
and good girl had the power to win and sway him
also proved only to her that his nature was more
grand, his character more noble, his mind more pure,
and his heart vastly larger than that of other men.
No! Margaret did not feel herself wronged, although
she knew that Imelda held an equally warm place in
his great heart.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>But as yet Imelda did not fully realize and understand
the full grandeur of Margaret’s nature; how
wholly uncalled for her fears were; and when she
gave expression to this fear that was making havoc
with her peace, Wilbur who knew and understood
the noble sentiments of his brave Margaret answered
the agitated girl:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where is the usually clear-headed woman, the
woman who has discussed so often these questions of
right and wrong? of individual liberty, of universal
liberty? the question of the emancipation of women
from sex slavery? the woman who has been claiming
and agitating for herself, and for her much wronged
sex, the right to the indisputable ownership of herself?
In accordance with all this, would you now
place all your holiest and purest feelings and desires
in a bondage most unnatural? Would you not by
such action admit the right of one person to dictate a
‘thou shalt’ and ‘thou shalt not’ to another?
Look up, my sweet. You do not think me, and
believe me, still so far in the old ruts and so deep in
the old superstitions and prejudices that in order to
love one girl I must prove false and disloyal in my
allegiance to another.</p>

<p class='c005'>“See! as yet we have not arrived at the point of
action. We have not yet the strength to stand and
walk alone. As yet we are only theorizing. The
few advocates of Love in Liberty with whom we
have been associating in an intimate circle are not
egotistic enough to expect our women, our girls, to
shake off the restraining hands of society and act in
accord with their beliefs and views. That would
mean ostracism. We dare not place so heavy a load
upon weak shoulders without giving them the assurance
that at all events their future is provided for.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Stern, demoralizing poverty binds our hands, and
until ways and means are found which will show us
in a clear light the road we are to travel we must
conquer nature’s desires and wait, patiently wait.
But shall this circumstance prevent us also from
folding the sweet loved ones to our hearts and from
laying the kiss of pure and holy love upon their lips?
Never! Imelda, you would not ask it. What is it to
us if the whole world declares the human heart is
capable of only one small dwarfed love. We know
better; we who have been developing under Nature’s
teachings. We will follow nature’s promptings and
permit our hearts to expand in the sunshine of their
beauty, wherever and whenever this beauty bursts in
its glory upon us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Placing his hand gently under and raising the
tear-wet face until he could look into the shining
moist eyes, and bending low his lips pressed hers in
a long and lingering kiss, and by and by under the
influence of his caresses and soothing words a quiet
peace stole over Imelda, only that subtle pain that
held her heart, as with an icy grip would torment her
and—well she knew what caused it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,—‘Harrisburg’”—Wilbur was speaking—“is
not the end of the world by any means. We
will meet again, my love. I feel it. Probably when
the clouds have passed away, when we can see clearer
and know what we can do and ought to do. And
then, who knows, in that unknown future into which
you are about to step, may be a work for you to perform.
Your destiny may be lying awaiting your
coming. There you may find him who will prove
your best loved one. Nay, sweet one; shake not
your head. I am not vain enough, not conceited
enough to think that I alone should possess the power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>to sway your gentle heart. No! I hope you may
prove yourself stronger and greater than the common
everyday woman, whose ideal of pure love is
centered in one poor, weak mortal with his one, two,
perhaps more, sterling good qualities yet who will
prove himself lacking in others equally good, nay,
perhaps better qualities, which will be represented
in another man but which by her must be passed by
unnoticed because not centered in the person of her
one love. No! my darling. I hope the time will
come when a grander passion will come to you than I
have inspired.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Wilbur smiled as he again folded her close and
kissed the trembling lips. “I appreciate the sweet
tender love that fills and swells your gentle breast,
but I know, if you do not, that it will be another
than myself who will be able to shake this woman’s
heart of yours to the very foundation of your being.
Under the influence of a mightier love than you have
yet felt you will awake to your full strength. Then
will come the time when you will arise to the height
and glory of your work in the cause of humanity, in
the cause of womankind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He spoke the words soothingly, smoothing the
glossy dark braids, as if thereby to cause the pain of
the present hour to gently pass over. Did he feel
that his words would prove prophetic? With a swift
motion peculiar to herself she threw her head slightly
back looking upward into the earnest eyes, taking
his face between both her hands, she said, softly,
gently:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wilbur, you are a man among men! A friend
whom any woman might well count a priceless treasure.
Whether or not it is true that my heart will
find another whom, in time, it will own king, this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>much I do know, that I know of no place where I
would rather rest than in your strong sheltering
arms, but the time has come that I must stand alone.
I am about to weigh the last anchor that holds me to
the old life. In a few hours I shall be speeding away,
cut loose from all the old ties. I will be brave now,
and calmly look the coming time squarely in the
face.” Saying which she disengaged herself from
the encircling arms.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where is Margaret?” Scarcely had the question
dropped from her lips when the answer came
just outside the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here! I am late, I know, and that too when I
wanted to be here early in order to have one more
hour with my darling girl, ere we are parted. But
mamma was quite sick this morning; something
unusual for her, as she generally has such good health.
I left her sleeping, however, and feeling much
better.” This last in answer to the anxious inquiry
that fell from two pairs of lips at the same time.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, my precious, precious darling, must I really
lose you? I cannot realize that it can be true that I
am to lose my friend, my Imelda;” and the two girls
sank into each other’s arms, clasping each other in a
tender loving embrace, mingling their pain and tears.
Wilbur stepped to the window and studied the tops
of the buildings upon which he gazed in order to
give these two tried and true friends an opportunity
for a last exchange of a multitude of thoughts and
emotions that were thronging their breasts and seeking
utterance in incoherent speech. But time is
merciless in its flight. Wilbur turned to remind the
girls that the final moments were drawing very near.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Mrs. Westcot will be getting uneasy if we
tarry longer and indeed we certainly will have no
time to lose if we wish to meet our little friend at the
appointed hour.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus admonished the girls made haste to prepare
to leave. A few minutes later the three were seated
in a car hurrying toward their destination. Imelda
had bade Mrs. Leland farewell the evening before—at
whose home had been spent the last evening the
three friends were together. She had also found
present there quite a number of her radical friends
whom Mrs. Leland had notified of the coming
departure of Imelda Ellwood; and had invited them
to meet her at her home. All who had received an
invitation had come, for Imelda was a favorite and
had found her way into many hearts. All were
sorry to lose the society of the intelligent young
lady friend and co-worker in the cause of humanity.
None had expressed more deep regret at the loss they
were all about to sustain than our white haired friend,
Mr. Roland. He had taken Imelda by the hand, long
and earnestly had he spoken, giving her much fatherly
advice, privately and otherwise, as to the life
she was about to enter upon. Among total strangers
the fact that Alice Westcot had been a girl friend in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>former days did not weigh much with the old man.
She was only one weak woman. In the midst of
these new surroundings Imelda would often find it
difficult to walk erect and self-reliant in the new path.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It will hardly be an atmosphere of truth,” said
he, “with which you will be surrounded, but rather
one of deceit and falsehood. Your powers of discerning
the pure from the debased will be severely
tried. There will be work to be done, for the true
worker is ever on the alert. You must be an opportunist,
ever awaiting the chance to strike while the
iron is hot. Ever keep your eyes open. Point out
the defects of a rotten system; the unholiness of an
unmated marriage; the uncleanness of lives united
without love; the loathsomeness of keeping up the
semblance of love when it has long since become a
putrid corpse. Keep your mind clear. Never let
lust—passion—in the guise of love, draw near your
side, tainting your fresh young life with sickening
noisomeness. It is difficult to see clear in the dark
labyrinth of society customs, and you may stumble
and fall. And oh, the difficulty of rising after such
fall! If it requires almost unlimited strength to
obtain a firm foothold at any time in the whirlpool of
fashion and custom, it will require strength superhuman
to rise in a struggle in which you have once
sunk, and it will take all your strength of will power,
all your keen sense of honor and justice, all your
sweet natural purity and self conscious pride to
always hold that queenly head erect and walk firmly
among the slippery pitfalls that unseen may lie along
your every path.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not a very pleasant contemplation that
her aged friend had called up before Imelda’s mental
view, but probably a much needed and wholesome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>lesson. “Forewarned is forearmed,” and if Imelda’s
future was to escape the temptation that so often
besets the lives of beautiful women, so much the better
for her, as it would save her many little struggles
of the soul. But on the other hand it would never
tend to harm her that she knew something of the
dark precipices of life. So she thanked Mr. Roland
for the well meant kindness that had prompted his
words, and in bidding him good bye she had permitted
him to kiss her young fresh lips, well knowing
that only the most disinterested concern for her
future prompted the action.</p>

<p class='c005'>One and all of the many kind friends had a parting
admonition, a well meant advice, a loving word
of farewell, all expressing the hope at some future
time to meet her again. Mrs. Leland had folded her
in her arms and held her there as a mother does her
tired babe, and indeed Imelda had been tired. The
events of the evening had been full of conflicting
emotions. The taking leave of friend after friend
was not a light task, and it had been a drain upon
her strength. She would have much preferred to
spend this last evening quietly in the close circle of
her most intimate friends, and yet she also knew
that she owed it to these others who had always
shown themselves so appreciative of her friendship,
of her small endeavors to aid them in their grand
work of humanity. She felt the desire to see them
all once more before forever stepping from the enchanted
circle, and above all she would have been
sorry had she failed to receive the parting clasp of
Mr. Roland’s hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>When it was all over, the lips quivered and the
eyes filled with tears, as she laid her face to Mrs.
Leland’s. The young matron gently passed her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>hand over the dark head brushing the heavy waves
of hair from the white brow and in doing so discovered
that Imelda was feverish. There had been too
much excitement and she feared it might prove
detrimental to the health of the young girl, so she
had a nice fresh cup of tea brought for her, then
folding her close in a farewell embrace she kissed her
again and yet again, giving her much good counsel
and many cheering words. She had then sent her
home, as she insisted upon going. More like a sister
than otherwise did Mrs. Leland seem to the parting
girl as indeed she always felt thus toward the young
matron. The girls never thought of keeping secrets
from her; she was one of them, as she always made
it a point of being in the confidence of Margaret,
which was given voluntarily, as indeed it would
have been difficult to be in the society of this woman
and not have full confidence and trust in her. She
won it from them and the girls knew only too well
they could find no better place for the safe keeping
of that which they wished to entrust to her.</p>

<p class='c005'>But we have been devious and must hasten to
rejoin the three friends as they now meet the little
lady so anxiously awaiting their arrival at the depot.
Her face lit up with an unmistakable expression of
relief, the words she spoke the next moment giving
proof of the anxiety to which she had been subjected.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, at last! at last! I thought you would never
come. I had all kinds of visions—of runaway
horses, of some great fire, of some accident wherein
you figured as the heroine. Then too I thought you
might have changed your mind at the eleventh hour.
Indeed I felt quite miserable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The whole company laughed. Imelda kissed
the little excited woman.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“You seem to have but a poor opinion of me.
Don’t you know that fickle-mindedness is not counted
among my faults? We still have fifteen minutes left
I believe,” looking up at the timepiece in the central
waiting room, “so just please calm yourself. I am
a fixture. You need not fear that you can easily rid
yourself of me now.” Imelda continued in this light
tone. The others imitating her example. The object
to be gained thereby was easily discerned, for
neither wanted to display the aching heart that lay
hidden within the bosom, but for all that none was
deceived. The eye so eloquently speaks the language
of the heart and their telegraphy was sending
swift messages back and forth. All too quickly the
passing moments flew. The train was ready and
would not wait. Both fair young travelers were
safely seated in their Pullman car. The last farewell
had been spoken, and as the puffing engine
steamed out from the depot the fluttering of white
handkerchiefs was the last view the friends had of
each other. With tear-wet eyes Margaret watched
the outgoing train, Wilbur’s face bearing almost as
sad a look as her own. When would they meet again?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Thus had come the beginning of the new life and
the past lay enshrouded in shadows. Almost at the
threshold of that new life Imelda was met by him
whose coming Wilbur had, in last moments preceding
the sundering from the old life, prophesied.
With Wilbur’s kisses yet warm on her lips, every
beat of her heart responding to the love he bore her,
there had been room in that heart to receive the impress
of another’s image. While still the memory of
Wilbur’s caresses thrilled her the kisses of the new-found
lover sent the blood bounding in ecstacy
through her veins. Those precious friends of the
past, would understand? But Norman,—would she
ever succeed in leading him to such heights of progress
as to enable him to see by the light of understanding
the glorious beauties of a boundless freedom?</p>

<p class='c005'>As yet she had not reached the topmost heights
herself, was not yet standing in the full glare of
light that should show her the path that lay in the
direction of perfect freedom. But she had seen the
brilliant star in the distance and she knew of dark
depths that were concealed, the dungeons where
prejudice and superstition held in bondage all of
nature’s pure desires. She vowed never, never to
wear the galling yoke of marriage.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>She was deliriously happy in this new love. She
found their thoughts blending in all things pertaining
to nature. Only as yet Norman had paid little
attention to progressive thought on this particular
subject. Possessing an innate veneration for all
women, he expected to find heaven in the arms of
one. That such a thing is not possible we would by
no means assert, for, contrary to the general rule
that arbitrary laws prove the ruin of loving hearts
and sensitive lives, there are cases where the one
love has proved to be the happiness of a lifetime;
but it is time that we rid ourselves of the illusion that
a compulsory marriage law can command such fidelity
and steadfastness that such cases instead of the
rare exception—as they really are—will be the rule.
The knowledge of perfect freedom—the freedom that
means none may have the right to say, “Thou shalt”
and “Thou shalt not,”—with the power this knowledge
can give we rise to glorious heights, and in such
knowledge is created a love which in its abandonment
to love, its power to achieve, its strength to
endure, a life opens before us that can never be
attained when fettered within prescribed limits.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was thus that Imelda felt, and to point out to
Norman the way wherein he would be enabled to
obtain the same views was what she felt to be now
her task. But oh, the difficulty, the magnitude of
her task! At least such it seemed to her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, too, there arose another specter from the
dark past. Norman Carlton was the descendant of a
proud family. In time past they had ranked with
the proudest and wealthiest of the country, and were
still reckoned among the first. His mother was a
dainty aristocrat, his sisters cultured and refined
ladies. No doubt the pride of blood had been instilled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>into his mind from early infancy. Would his
love stand the test of Imelda’s past? Her father?
Yes, her father had been a man as cultured and refined
as ever a Carlton had been,—she felt that. But
on the side of her mother she knew it was different.
Then like dark apparitions appeared before her
mind’s eye the forms of Cora and Frank. These two
were certainly living proofs (if they were yet living)
of bad blood in her veins. How would it be when
this record of her gloomy past was laid before him?
Would he stand the test?</p>

<p class='c005'>True, Imelda understood, with the high ideals
she possessed, that if he did not stand those tests he
was unworthy her love. But again, love in its unborn
glory fails to grasp such philosophy, and longs
only for the completion of the union of loving hearts.
With all these difficulties in mind Imelda was not
looking to the distant future. It was rather the near
future with which she had to contend, the winning
of her best loved lover.</p>

<p class='c005'>After parting from Norman under the waving
maple trees and after being refreshed by a healthful
sleep her mind wandered to those other friends in
their distant western home, and, grasping her pen,
she spent two hours in writing; at the end of which
time two closely written sheets lay before her. Having
sealed and mailed the same she joined Alice and
the two little ones at the breakfast table. Lawrence
Westcot had breakfasted at a much earlier hour and
had gone to his business. Usually Imelda joined him,
as she was an early riser, but this morning the early
hours had been given to her letter which had been
directed to Margaret.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rather an unexpected pleasure,” was Alice’s
comment as Imelda made her appearance and seated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>herself at the table. She generally came to assist
the little ones, as they were sometimes unruly and
clamorous until the hungry little stomachs had been
satisfied. But that she should wait so long ere satisfying
her own physical wants was a new departure
and Alice looked as though she would like an explanation.
Imelda smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been writing letters,” she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice did not seem wholly satisfied. The new
sweet light that shone in the young girl’s eyes could
hardly have been produced by the doubtful pleasure
of writing letters in the early morning hours. (Alice
always found writing letters a task.) But she asked
no questions at present, though a troubled look
shadowed the blue eyes as she turned her attention
to discussing the dainty meal before her. Imelda
attended to the wants of the little ones first and then
sent them scampering off for a morning romp.
Scarcely had their childish forms disappeared from
view when an anxious “Well?” dropped from the
lips of Alice. Imelda smiled. Feigning not to understand,
she repeated the “Well,” with an additional
“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, pshaw, Imelda,” she said, “You cannot
deceive me; something has happened, and you may as
well tell me first as last.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda’s laugh rang out merrily at this assumption
of the little lady.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your sense of perception is very acute this
morning, but I will no longer keep you in suspense.
Norman Carlton made me an offer of marriage last
evening.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have accepted!” exclaimed Alice. For
the moment it was hard to read the pale, immovable
features.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“No I have not accepted.” Alice sighed, while
a puzzled expression settled upon her face. She
found the young girl rather difficult to understand.
Why was she so slow in telling what there was to
tell?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Finish your breakfast, Alice, and then I will
tell you all.” Thus assured a little more attention
was paid to the tempting viands, but Alice for some
time was toying impatiently with her knife, waiting
until the imperturbable Imelda should be done with
her breakfast. Presently she folded her napkin,
thus indicating that she was through. Then she
arose and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, Alice, we will go either to your room
or mine where we can talk undisturbed.” The proposition
met the favor of the young woman and soon
they were seated in the cosy room of the fair mistress.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice listened while Imelda took her into her
confidence and told her the story of her love. She
knew of Imelda’s aversion to marriage. She had
come to understand some of her views and though
she did not indorse them yet she could not but recognize
much in them that would prove an everlasting
blessing to humanity could they be put into practice.
She felt if it were opportune she would not hesitate
to hold out her longing hands for the tempting boon
of freedom. Had she not told Imelda of moments
when she felt like cursing the fetters that bound her
even though they were golden? But Lawrence
Westcot was known as an honorable man; one who
heaped upon his wife golden favors; who daily sought
to strew her pathway with flowers. All of this was
true, yet time and again the blue eyes would fill with
tears. The merry sprite was not always such when
within her own chamber, and Imelda’s confidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>called forth no answering smile, and yet Imelda knew
she always wore her brightest smile when the handsome
young man was a visitor at their home. With
an effort Alice banished the gloomy look and wished
her friend happiness when she would become the wife
of Norman Carlton.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,” said Imelda, “have I not told you? I
will never be his wife.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“You will never—be—his wife? And yet you
are happy—in his love? Imelda, what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean,” Imelda replied, “to be wiser than
you were, little one. I mean to always keep my
lover.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was too much, and Alice burst into tears.
That Imelda was surprised was a mild way of expressing
her emotion. A dim suspicion was born in her
mind, which, however, she tried to repress. No, no;
she did not believe it,—and yet it might be. She
would watch, she would see. Taking the excited
little woman in her arms, Imelda kissed and tried to
soothe her, and after a time was apparently successful.
Then she went to look after her little charges.
No sooner had the door closed upon her retreating
figure than Alice with trembling fingers locked it and
casting herself upon the bed burst into a storm of
sobs, for which there was no apparent cause, and
which were so passionate that the merry mistress of
the beautiful home could scarcely be recognized.</p>

<p class='c005'>Surely a strange creature is woman. Of unfathomable
depths her caprices; whose moods are so
various that it would prove an almost impossible task
to solve the pretty riddle. In some such way as this
the conventional novelist would doubtless comment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>upon the action of Alice, but we know better than to
judge her thus. It was neither a caprice nor mood
that caused the bitter sobs to shake her to her inmost
being. She was no riddle. It was all plain enough
to those who would see. Nature’s voice was clamoring
for nature’s own. But man-made laws, with iron
hand, stood between.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice had not known why,—why, spite of the
disgust she sometimes felt at the life surrounding
her, she yet was light and happy. She had not yet
understood what it was that brought the sunshine to
banish the clouds of her life. But what had she to
complain of? If you had asked her I doubt if she
would have been able to clearly answer the question,
yet it was all so clear, so apparent.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her husband was all that has been stated, but no
special credit could attach to him for that. Wealth
was his to command. He never thought of refusing
any wish of hers that money could satisfy. If any
one had accused Lawrence Westcot of unkindness
to his wife he would have opened wide his eyes in
surprise. Did she not have everything that heart
could desire? That she would turn from him when
he approached her; that little ripples of disgust shook
her frame as he bent to kiss her; that her eyes would
flash in angry scorn when he attempted to secure to
himself the rights the law gave him—certainly was
not his fault. That he was not fine-grained enough
to desist on such occasions could be no reason for
laying blame on his shoulders. Was she not <i>his</i>?—his
by the wholly rites of matrimony? And why
should she not comply with his desires and demands?</p>

<p class='c005'>And yet, handsome Lawrence Westcot was a favorite
wherever he went, especially with the fair sex.
Strong, healthy, full of spirits, there were few who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>stopped to look for traces of greater refinement, but
rather enjoyed the fiery look that would sometimes
cause a rush of blood to the fair face that came under
its power.</p>

<p class='c005'>But we will leave Lawrence Westcot for the
present and return to Imelda. As nothing happened
during the hours of the day that would be of interest
to us we pass them over until the shades of evening
brought her handsome lover to her side. She had
donned a soft white cashmere. No ornament of any
kind, only a snowy rosebud nestling amidst the dusky
coils of hair. The flushed cheek and the happy light
in the dark eyes made a picture to gladden the heart
of any lover. She was sitting in a reclining position
in a large arm chair, shading her eyes from the
bright light of the chandelier, with a fan artistically
finished with black lace, sparkling with diamond
dust, a present of the fair Alice, who was sitting at
the piano, softly playing an accompaniment to a sad
little air that she was singing. A mass of pink gauze
enveloped Alice’s slender form like a cloud, from
which the shoulders rose and gleamed like marble.
A beautiful picture, thought Norman, as he stood in
the open doorway.</p>

<p class='c005'>But another had also been feasting his eyes upon
the fair form. From the low French window which
led to the balcony without, another pair of eyes were
gazing upon Imelda’s fresh young beauty. Lawrence
Westcot was standing there in the shadow of the
night. Not a glance did he have just then for the
little woman who was his wife and who was softly
singing to herself. His whole being was thrilled by
that other who now glanced toward the door. The
look which beamed from her face at that moment
was a revelation to him and the look on Norman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>face corroborated it. Muttering a curse his teeth
sank deep into his lip. Quickly he stepped further
into the darkness and was lost in the winding walks
of the beautiful garden.</p>

<p class='c005'>Intuitively Norman knew, when his eyes rested
on Imelda’s figure, that she had dressed for him.
Never had she appeared anything but beautiful to
him, but tonight she seemed to surpass herself. He
had never seen her in anything but somber black, or
at best in a soft, unassuming gray gown; so that the
effect of the pure white of her attire this evening was
a revelation. After greeting the hostess he seated
himself at the side of his loved one. Alice meanwhile,
continuing her singing, evidently trying in
vain to hide the tears in her voice. But her fear was
needless. The world for these two did not extend to
where she was sitting. They were wholly absorbed
in each other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Finding herself so utterly overlooked, Alice rose
from her seat and gliding to the open window soon
found herself gazing up into the starlit heavens.
What was it that so rebelliously stirred her inmost
soul? Had the two in the parlor wronged her in any
way? Were not both dearly loved friends, and was
it not her desire that both should be happy? Slipping
down from the balcony into the walk below which
was flanked on either side with blooming plants,
Alice fled down, down until the splashing of a fountain
greeted her ear, beside which she now sank.
Dipping her hand into the cool water she let it play
over the white fingers. Her bosom heaved and in a
little while the crystal drops from her eyes mingled
with the sparkling waters of the fountain. She was
fighting out a battle, here under the starlit heavens.
How dare she own even to herself what it was that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>moved her so? Was it the poisoned arrows of
Imelda’s views that had sunk deep into her soul?</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no!” was the answer she made to this question;
“Be truthful. When you acknowledge so
much, go farther and acknowledge still more. Remember
this man was your friend long ere Imelda
came to be a pleasant companion in your house; long
ere you ever heard one word of the girl’s beautiful
doctrine. His voice was music, his smile heaven to you.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But oh, I did not, could not know,” continued
the unhappy woman to herself. “Only when she
came and told me of what she had won, did my heart
awake and realize what its cravings are; what all this
sunshine in my life means. Now all will be darkness,
utter darkness!” and as if the climax had now
been reached the white hand covered the quivering
face, and the pearly drops trickled from between
her fingers.</p>

<p class='c005'>After awhile the storm in the heaving bosom was
somewhat allayed; her breathing became more regular,
the sobs ceased and removing her hands she was
about to lave the tear-stained face in the cool water
when she became aware of the near presence of a man,
whom she now saw was leaning against a large fir
tree and watching her every movement.</p>

<p class='c005'>The suddenness of her discovery almost caused
Alice to scream. Although the man had risen she
could not for the moment decide who he might be, as
he was standing in the shadows, but seeing that he
was discovered he stepped out into the full light and—with
a gasp Alice recognized her husband. How
long had he been standing there, how long had he
been watching her? A somewhat defiant air settled
upon her countenance as without a word she proceeded
to lave her face, as she had intended doing.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“Rather a queer place for making your toilet,
is it not?” he queried. “I believe there could have
been more suitable places found in your home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice would rather not have answered, but felt it
was not good policy to pass his words over unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have a splitting headache, and came out into
the open air and it was very tempting to feel the
cool water on my burning temple.”</p>

<p class='c005'>His lip curled. “I have not the least doubt,”
he made answer, “that your head aches. It seems
to be the natural result when a woman indulges in
such a ‘good cry’ as I have witnessed during the last
half hour. Was the cry a result of the headache or
the headache the result of the cry?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice detected the sneer underlying the words,
but chose to appear unconscious.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whichever you please; my pain is great enough
to cause the tears, and tears again are liable to produce
headache.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Prevaricating!” he sneered. “But, my lady,
I see deeper, and have been seeing rather deep for
some time past. But to change the subject, I have
had a revelation tonight. Our friends, your friend
and mine, have concluded to become more than
friends; that is, if appearances do not deceive.”</p>

<p class='c005'>His eyes were resting searchingly upon the face
of the woman before him, and his cunning was in
vain. Not a line of the pale face moved. She continued
laving the aching brow and swollen eyelids
and vouchsafed him no answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You heard what I said?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I heard what you said.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, what do you think of it?”—this time impatiently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Think of it? What could I think of it but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>that Imelda could not do better. I must compliment
you on having a friend whom I consider a gentleman
in every respect.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, indeed! It is quite a compliment I must
acknowledge, but if you think you have washed yourself
enough permit me to remind you it would now
be in good taste to return to the house and pay just a
little attention to our guest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For some reason he was pleased to be most
sarcastic tonight. Such moods she feared. His
tongue was then sharper than a two-edge sword. So
then she drew the filmy lace handkerchief from her
bosom and proceeded to wipe the water from her
face. Suddenly, and taking her quite unawares, he
bent and kissed the white shoulder. As if stung by
an asp she pushed him from her with such force that
he nearly fell backward into the water.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How dare you?” she exclaimed. His face was
white to the lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will show you how I dare if you dare to
repeat such an action. A pretty pass it has come to,
if I may not kiss my own wife when I choose. Return
to the house with me at once. This moonlit
show has been kept up long enough.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Without a single word Alice turned and walked
back to the house with her husband at her side, but
when they returned to the brightly lighted rooms
they found them empty. Norman and Imelda had
disappeared.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice, to avoid further persecution, fled to her
own room where she hastily disrobed and sought her
couch, but her temples were throbbing in a manner
that did not promise sleep. She lay for some time
pressing her hands to the aching head, when she
heard steps outside her door and immediately after
a quick rap. She recognized both step and rap. She
lay with bated breath, giving no indication that she
heard, when the rap was repeated more loud and
forcible than before. Again no answer. A third
time the rap was repeated, accompanied by a loud
demand to open immediately.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not tonight, Lawrence,” came in pleading,
quavering accents. “I am sick tonight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Open!” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please, Lawrence,” pleaded the voice within.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you open?” came threateningly from the
outside. Trembling in every nerve Alice rose and
unlocked the door to admit the man she called husband.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“What do you mean?” he asked, grasping her
arm in a manner anything but gentle, “what do you
mean by locking your door?”</p>

<p class='c005'>By this time Alice was wrought up to a hysterical
pitch. With a quick movement she threw off the
hand that held her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I locked the door to be safe from intrusion. I
am sick tonight, and wish to be alone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dare say,” was the unfeeling response. “If
it had been some one else who wished admittance,
our honored guest, for instance, the door would not
have been so firmly locked. Your husband, however,
is not so welcome.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lawrence!” almost shrieked the sorely tried
woman. “How dare you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, I dare anything, as you will soon find.
Just now, I order you back to your bed, and to keep
quiet until I join you, in a few moments.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lawrence! You—do—not—mean to stay?”
gasped the poor suffering woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I—just—mean—to—stay;” mimicking
her frenzied appeal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I am sick tonight, oh, so sick!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The sickness then must be rather sudden. But
madam, it is rather a flimsy trick to rid yourself of
your husband’s presence. I advise you, however, to
take matters more coolly. By this time you ought
to understand and to know who will come out victor.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Alice did know who came out victor in this
instance. But the morning dawned upon a fever-flushed
face, and ere the sun was many hours in the
heavens a doctor stood at the bedside of the little
wife, who gravely shook his head as he listened to
the ravings of his patient, which—if such utterances
can be relied upon—revealed a tale of woe to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>attendants that ought to fill the heart of every true
woman and man with horror.</p>

<p class='c005'>The hours passed into days and the days into
weeks, and yet the fever raged unabated. Imelda,
who passed the days and nights in sleepless anxiety
at the sick woman’s bedside was well nigh worn out,
even though an experienced nurse was there to share
the responsibilities and care. The little ones were
banished to another portion of the house, so that
their childish prattle and laughter might not disturb
the sick mother. Lawrence Westcot came and went
to and from the sick chamber, wearing a gloomy
countenance, but his presence there was not at all
helpful, as it invariable caused the patient to be very
uneasy and restless, even though he did not come
within the range of her vision. She seemed to feel
his presence and the physician fearing the effect upon
her nervous system advised the husband to make his
visits short. Sometimes he bent above her, laying
his hand upon her fevered brow. Unconscious
though she was she would with a quick nervous movement
throw his hand aside, muttering incoherent
words.</p>

<p class='c005'>Both Imelda and the nurse observed that invariably
the sick woman would be worse after those visits
of the husband; although of short duration they were
glad when they were over.</p>

<p class='c005'>Almost three weeks passed ere the much-feared
crisis came. By this time the patient was very weak
and it was apparent that life hung by a thread.
Anxiously bending over the couch the two friends
watched while the clock ticked the hours away.
Slowly they crept on; slowly, softly, almost imperceptibly
the life of the sufferer seemed to ebb away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Twelve, one, two o’clock, and still no change.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Half past two, the door of the room softly opened
and Lawrence Westcot entered. Imelda’s heart gave
a bound. Why must he come at such a time?
Stepping softly he drew near. Imelda placed her
finger upon her lips in token of caution. Coming
close to the side of the dying woman he stood gazing
down upon her. What his thoughts might be could
not be known from the calm, unmoved appearance
of his countenance, but certainly they were not pleasant
thoughts. How could they be, when he so well
knew what had brought his wife so close to death’s
door? If she should die, would not her death lie at
his door? Would he not be compelled to own himself
her murderer?</p>

<p class='c005'>Five, ten minutes passed, then Alice moved.
Imelda laid her hand upon his arm and bent a pleading
look upon him. Immediately he stepped back
into the shadows of the room and there waited the
issue. Restlessly the head moved upon the pillow.
The eyelids quivered and fluttered open, the lips
moved, Imelda bent to catch the low whisper that
was merely a breath.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Water!” came faint, scarcely audible, from the
fever-parched lips. With a teaspoon a few drops at
a time were administered, the patient apparently
gaining strength from the cooling liquid. The blue
eyes opened wide, but they were clear with the light
of reason. Presently they closed again, and soon a
slow, even breathing told that sleep, natural restful
sleep, had once more come to the sufferer’s relief.
The nurse bent above her and listened, laying her
fingers upon the fluttering pulse. Presently, standing
erect, she whispered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is safe for tonight. I will continue the
watch. Miss Ellwood, you had better retire and rest.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Imelda’s breast was heaving. The strain had
been a severe one, and feeling that it would be impossible
long to control herself she hastily left the
room, followed by Westcot. Just outside the door
he laid his hand upon her arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She will be saved, you think?” He seemed
to be anxious and serious. Had not this man with
his cruelty almost murdered the woman who was as
yet lying at death’s door? It cost Imelda an effort
to be civil.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe so,” she answered. “According to
the doctor’s statement if she should safely pass this
night there is every hope of her recovery.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For several moments he did not answer, then—“Thank
you,” and ere Imelda was aware of his intention
he had taken her hand and lifting it he quickly
touched it with his lips. With a hasty movement
she withdrew her hand, but before she could speak
he had said “Goodnight,” and swiftly walking away
left her standing there alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda stood looking at the hand he had kissed,
and then with an unconscious movement drew her
handkerchief across the spot his lips had touched.
She shuddered. What did it mean? Without waiting
to answer her own question she turned and
hastily sought her room. She was tired, O, so tired.
Never since Alice had been tossing in the fever had
she known what it was to sleep a whole night through.
Snatching an hour, or two at most, always ready at
a moment’s notice to return to her post at the side of
the sick one, she had scarce found time to eat or
catch a breath of fresh air,—and now it was three
o’clock in the morning. O, how tempting looked the
snowy draped bed. She felt as if she could sink into
its soft embrace, never to rise again. The night was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>already well advanced; two or three hours at most
was all she expected to sleep. The faithful nurse
was just as much in need of rest as herself. A moment
she hesitated. Should she risk it? The nurse
was positive that for the rest of the night Alice
would sleep. She no longer hesitated, but hastily
disrobing and donning a snowy nightdress, scarce
had her head touched the pillow when she was already
unconscious and in the land of dreams.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>For the first time Imelda’s mind was free. She
had left Alice sleeping. Not in a dull, feverish
stupor, constantly interrupted with delirious mutterings
but sleeping, actually and really sleeping.
And although her breathing was only a gentle fluttering,
it was so weak, it was a quiet sleep, and she
knew that for a few hours, at least, she could safely
trust her to the faithful nurse. So Imelda slept the
sleep of the just.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the morning sunlight streamed through
the open window, flooding the room with its bright
glory, a servant had softly entered and with deft
fingers closed the shutters, darkening the room so
that the slumbers of the completely exhausted girl
might not be disturbed; the nurse meanwhile remaining
faithful and true to her trust. Now and then a
maid softly opened the door to listen, but Imelda
slept on, and when the doctor came he gave the order
to let her sleep by all means, until she should awake
of herself. So the hours of the day passed and the
evening shades were falling ere that death-like sleep
was lifted and Imelda opened her eyes. The deep
hush and darkness that prevailed left her for a long
time in semi-unconsciousness, a delicious drowsiness
folding her in its power, but by and by it passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>away, leaving her brain more clear, and presently,
all in an instant, she knew and remembered.</p>

<p class='c005'>But how long had she slept? It was three
o’clock when she sought her bed and only two hours
before the morning light would appear. It was still
dark, yet she did not feel as if she had slept only a
short time, but rather had the sensation of having
slept a long while, she was so wide awake, and—yes!
she was hungry, very hungry. She reached out her
hand for her watch, which she remembered having
placed upon the stand near the bedside. It was
there, but when she placed it to her ear she made the
discovery that it had stopped. Then she struck a
light, having a lucifer always within reach. By the
flickering flame she saw that her watch had stopped
at twenty minutes of two. A puzzled look overspread
her face. What did it mean? Just then she
thought she heard a footstep outside her door; the
next instant the door was softly opened.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who is there?” she hastily inquired, her heart
giving a bound, as she was not in the habit of leaving
her door unlocked. Could she have forgotten it? A
soft laugh answered her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it you, Mary?” she asked, recognizing the
voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Miss Imelda, it is I. Have you decided
to return to life? I was beginning to fear you were
going to sleep right over into the next world.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, what time is it?” was Imelda’s next
question, still surprised and puzzled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Almost eight o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Eight o’clock! Why, Mary, you ought to
have called me ere this. Mrs. Boswell ought to have
been relieved some time ago. But why is it so dark?
I thought I had the windows open.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“So you had. I made free to close them but
will open them now,” saying which the girl unfastened
and opened the shutters. Instead of the bright
sunshine, as Imelda had expected, only a hazy twilight
filled it with dim shadows.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What does this mean?” she stammered.
“Why, it is quite dark. Did you not say that it is
almost eight o’clock?” She was growing impatient.
Mary’s laugh again rang through the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” she said “it is eight o’clock, not in the
morning but in the evening.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda was sitting bolt upright in bed now.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What! Do you mean to say that I have slept
all day through?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just that, and nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, that was wrong! I ought to have been
called long ago. How is——” she stopped, a sudden
fear holding her tongue a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. Westcot is getting better,”—supplementing
the unfinished question and answering it at the
same time. “She, like yourself, has been sleeping
all day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And Mrs. Boswell——?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Has also had a nap while I sat with Mrs. Westcot,
and if you will rise and dress I will prepare you
some—breakfast,” and laughing again she disappeared
leaving Imelda to her own reflections, but first
having lit the gas overhead. No hesitation now.
Hastily she arose and quickly made her toilet.
Donning a wrapper she twisted the dark hair into a
shining coil, and in a few minutes descended to the
dining room where Mary had spread for her a tempting
meal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda was a favorite with the servants, who
were always willing to do a favor for this fair girl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>from the west, who was so considerate. It was well
known that Mrs. Westcot was also from the western
metropolis, and they often wondered if people in the
west generally were so kind and considerate. It
would have been impossible for the gentle-hearted
Alice to assume aristocratic airs, therefore she could
always depend upon her servants, and all hearts were
filled with fear while the gentle mistress was raving
of real or fancied woes, and when at last, after weary
weeks, the crisis was over, it was as if a heavy cloud
had passed away, and the gloomy faces were bright.</p>

<p class='c005'>Having done ample justice to the generous
repast, and feeling much refreshed, Imelda sped to
the chamber above. Softly she opened the door and
moved to the bedside. Mrs. Boswell was sitting with
her elbow resting upon the bed, her head upon her
hand. She never moved as Imelda stepped to her
side. Bending down she found that the nurse was
fast asleep. A pang smote her that while she, in the
strength of youth, had slept the day away the much
older woman had continued at her post. True, Mary
had said that she had relieved her for awhile, but
Imelda knew that she, like herself, needed a good
long rest, and she decided that she should have it.
Seeing that Alice too was sleeping, she gently
touched Mrs. Boswell on the shoulder and slightly
shaking her the nurse awoke with a start. Imelda
held up a warning finger to prevent her from making
an outcry. But the woman was frightened. She
felt guilty at having been found asleep at her post of
duty. Hastily reaching for her watch she breathed
a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only ten minutes,” she whispered. “She has
been sleeping so long,” indicating Alice, “that I suppose
the quiet has overpowered me.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“And no wonder,” said Imelda,—“you are certainly
in need of rest. I will now take your place
while you sleep all night and all day tomorrow, too,
if you wish. So just give me the directions for
tonight, and then away to your couch.” The woman
smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you. I am only too glad to accept.”
After giving the proper directions she added:
“And now if you will excuse me I will accept your
kind offer and sleep. Mary took my place for several
hours or I fear I could not have held out. In the
morning I will be ready to take my place again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So the nurse withdrew and left Imelda alone with
her sick friend, and as she largely imitated the example
of the young girl and slept until the afternoon
of the next day, Imelda had a long watch before her.</p>

<p class='c005'>But we are forestalling. While the nurse has
gone to recruit her strength in sleep we will remain
with Imelda and follow the outline of her thoughts
as she watched her sick friend. Over three weeks
have now passed since the promenade of the lovers
in the moonlight under the silver maples,—the evening
after that on which for the first time she had discarded
her mourning garments, when they had spent
two happy hours together, Imelda adroitly preventing
a repetition of the pleadings of the night before.
She was happy, and was willing that Norman should
know it. He in turn had been content to drink the
kisses from the dewy lips and leave the morrow to
take care of itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Since that evening Imelda had seen but little of
her lover. If he came in the evening she scarcely
ever had longer than a half hour to give him. The
cloud that hung above this house was too dark to
admit of much happiness or joy for them. On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>other hand it did not give them the leisure to discuss
the question nearest their hearts, and Imelda did not
wish it just now.</p>

<p class='c005'>Long ere this, had the answer come to the long
letter that she had written to Margaret. But not
alone in Margaret’s delicate tracing had the answer
come. A long letter had also come in the bolder
handwriting of Wilbur Wallace. Her heart gave a
bound as she recognized the hand, while the rich
blood rushed in a hot wave to her face dyeing her
temples, ears and neck. What would he have to say?
With a beating heart she had opened it. Something
impelled her to lay Margaret’s aside until she first
perused Wilbur’s letter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>With Imelda we will read Wilbur’s letter:</p>

<p class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>My Darling</span>: The fact that I am writing this
to you must of necessity be proof that Margaret has
laid before me your letter containing the news that
already the event has come into your life which I, in
our parting hour, prophesied would come. Though
I still claim you as my darling, and though my heart
still goes to meet you with the same tender emotions,
I cannot do otherwise than say I am pleased. I am
glad that that other has so soon stepped into your
life, and, building upon the past, I take the responsibility
on myself of giving the advice you ask of
Margaret.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The fact alone that you love this man, that
your heart has so fully gone into his keeping, is to
me the best evidence of his trustworthiness. Not
but that you, as well as many another, are liable to
make mistakes as to the character of any individual
you may come in contact with, but in a case of spontaneous
love I feel and know that the purity of mind
itself, of which you are possessed, would intuitively
recognize that which is not equally pure.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That Norman should still be bound by old
superstitions and creeds may prove an obstacle to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>speedy consummation of your love. It is here your
work begins; here your strength will be tested. If
you would be a priestess in our holy work you will
be expected to remain true to the sentiments you
have so often expressed. Your soul must remain
free and unfettered, even though the man may be
purity personified. Not a semblance even of the
power the law gives to a husband must you put into
his hands. If your love is great enough to trust
him he will be generous enough to trust you, or he is
not the man he has represented himself to be. If he
is not generous enough to trust you, then your intuition
will have been at fault—the blindness of a common
love has been laid upon your vision.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where lies the beginning of your work?—you
ask. I will tell you. Your first duty is one that
you owe to him and to yourself. You say that in
your past life lie hidden many dark spots. It is
your duty in this case to lay bare these dark spots in
the full light of day. It is thus you will test his
strength of character. As he comes of a long line of
Puritan ancestors this will be necessary. The old
prejudices may be so deeply rooted that, rather than
take to his arms one who, although not responsible
for the actions of others, may by the ties of blood be
allied to those that are, he may be willing to crush
out a love that would leave his own heart mangled
and bleeding. If such should be the case, my little
girl, I understand full well that bitter pain must
then for a while gnaw at the cords of your heart.
But it will pass, and in passing leave you purer and
stronger than ever.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If, on the other hand, he stands the test I feel
sure it will be only a short time until his whole soul
will come to understand the grand sublimity of full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>and untrammeled liberty. Love cannot be fettered.
Love will always remain free; the greater his freedom
the more certainty is ours of retaining him to
make bright our lives. Try to fetter him, he unfolds
his wings and mockingly takes his departure. Then,
what are we to do with our empty lives?</p>

<p class='c005'>“In justice to woman we must admit that she is
at the greater disadvantage, no matter in what light
the case may be placed. In marriage, it matters not
how just may be the man whom she calls ‘lord,’ she
is, she remains, his property, according to the mandates
of the law. No matter how willing he may be
that she shall enjoy perfect freedom, society takes it
upon itself to place a watch upon her. If her husband
has no sense of honor, or of what is due to himself,
the stern finger of the law points it out to him.
Society prepares a code for her that she is bound to
respect and accept as her guide. The path which he
is asked to walk is not nearly so straight. There are
many recesses and angles in it, if he chooses to
explore them. If he does so quietly nothing will
be said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“On the other hand, we know only too well
if woman refuses marriage, it is equivalent to
throwing away all hope of ever enjoying life as nature
has designed. If she dares to thus enjoy she
is ostracized from society.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At the present time we are still in the dark.
But may we not hope, sometime, to grow strong
enough to defy the mandates of society? May not
love find a way that shall yet defy all the lynx-eyed
agents of a corrupt moral code? May we not hope
that man and woman both may yet be natural as the
new-born babe, when it is first placed in the mother’s
arms—at nature’s fount?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“Will you be strong, my Imelda? Think you,
you can take your Norman by the hand and lead him
on until he stands upon your own sublime heights?
Until he stands at your side? Then side by side to
explore the unknown heights that still lie beyond
your field of vision?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Be brave, my precious one; be strong, and
when the time comes when we shall meet again (and
I feel that it will come), and I fold you to my heart,
pressing warm kisses on your lips, some prophetic
spirit tells me that your Norman will stand by and
understand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There must and will come a time when the full
glory of a free love will be understood and enjoyed.
So look up to the goal in view; bravely work on, and
remember there is strength in the knowledge of unity
of thought and purpose of those who work in a like
cause, even though your friends with their supporting
love are distant. Remaining as ever, loving you
with a love that is absolutely pure, I am yours for
truth of purpose, and for the best humanity.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Wilbur.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>A long drawn sigh escaped the lips of Imelda as
she laid the closely written sheets upon her knees.
Well she knew that he was right. In the still hours
of the night watches, by the side of the sick friend
the thought had come to her again that open truth
was the only course for her to pursue. But oh, how
gigantic the task appeared. In all the three weeks
the subject had never been touched upon again by
them. Few indeed had been the moments she had
been able to accord him, her strength being tested to
its utmost in her capacity as nurse. Being well
aware of the state of things Norman Carlton was far
too noble to press for the reason of the loved girl’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>views at such a time. For the present he accepted
the boon of her love as a priceless jewel of whose
possession he was assured.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Imelda knew that the hour was coming when
he would expect an answer to his question, and, as
Wilbur had stated, it was then her work would begin.
If she dreaded that coming hour, was she to blame?
Folding the letter she placed it back in the envelope
and with the action there came to her with overwhelming
force, the realization of the grandeur of
this man’s character. What purity, what nobility!
Even as the new love more fully filled out her life so
did she understand better the true worth of the man
who had first called her love into being.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, Margaret darling,” was her mental comment,
“when your heart chose Wilbur as its best
beloved, it made a grand selection; no one will ever
find his way into your life who will be able to look
to you from a loftier height than that upon which he
stands.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Recalling her wandering thoughts she next
opened the epistle from Margaret, for such it proved
to be. Such a long, warm, glowing letter; overflowing
with the love her pure young heart contained.
She had filled page after page, concluding with the
words:</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now my dearest girl, I think I have made
my meaning clear. I have given you the best advice
that I know of. I know, however, that it is the
same as Wilbur’s, only perhaps in other words, and
I feel that now we shall not be disappointed in our
brave girl. Let me add one thing. I understand
fully how difficult the making of such a revelation
will prove; and yet it <i>must</i> be made. I can see nothing
else you can do and remain true to yourself and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>lover. Not the shadow of a suspicion, of a deception,
must lie between you. I will not say disgrace; that
will exist, if it exist at all, only in Norman’s <i>mind</i>.
But now for my advice:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Write the history of your life. That will be
easier. You can tell him all, everything, without the
disadvantage of seeing in his face the emotions that
such a history might call into play. He will have
time to think and understand the full import of
it all. You will not then receive an immediate
answer prompted by an impulse that might prove a
barrier to your love. Cool, calm reflection is necessary
in such a case, and as my own Imelda possesses
her full share of common sense she can but see the
wisdom of such a course.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Be brave, my dearest friend, my own loved
one. If this man is worthy of your love he will
stand the test. If he does not stand it, then I can
but say he was not worthy. And now remember—three
hearts beat in love for you, and the united
strength of that love is bent on the success of your
heart’s dearest hope (for of course my mother knows),
and hoping to be reunited in a not too distant future,
thus writes and advises your most sincere and loving
friend,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>This letter had been folded and placed side by
side with that other one. Long had Imelda sat with
bowed head and folded hands. Yes! both kind and
loving friends were right. An inner voice told her
this was the only course to pursue. But the condition
of the sick friend had not permitted her to think
of it. Every minute of her time had been devoted
to her. Her lover must wait until the dark, uncertain
hours would be past; but now as Imelda sat and
watched the peaceful sleeper, she realized that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>could not spend the long hours of the night watch to
better advantage than in the performance of this
duty. The dreaded hour had passed; hope and sunshine
were again seeking admittance at the portals
of this home, and Norman was waiting, patiently
waiting, for his answer. So when the morning broke,
with its pale light, she folded the closely written
sheets. With trembling hands and beating heart
she wrote the address and sent them to their destination.
Would he stand the test? When tried by
this crucial ordeal, would he prove faithful and true?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The sultry summer day was at its close, and
Norman Carlton had just finished reading the letter
that Imelda had written the night before. A
troubled look was upon the frank and honest face, as
he stood at the open window looking out at the falling
shadows, but seeing nothing. In one hand he
still held the fateful sheets; the other hand he held
to his aching temples. He stood and gazed until
dusky twilight faded into starlit night. Ever and
anon a deep sigh escaped the drawn lips as he thought,
and thought, and thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>But what was it he thought? Did that miserable
tale of woe show him only the impracticability of an
alliance with a child of the people? A woman whose
mother had no right, according to the views of society,
to the title of “lady;” whose sister had made an
outcast of herself; whose brother might, even now,
be occupying the cell of a criminal; whose past life
had been one long privation and struggle with fate.
His own lady mother and sister! Was it not his duty
to first consult their views, their feeling upon the
matter?</p>

<p class='c005'>Or was it that he was made of more noble material?
Were his views so broad that it was of no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>consequence what the world might say? It could
hardly be expected, when we consider the training of
his past life, that he would now have no battle to
fight. It was not pleasant to know that the woman
who had won his love should be so unpleasantly connected,
but while this knowledge was to him most
depressing, it also had the effect of raising, many fold,
the respect he held for her. What could have been
easier for her than to keep these matters secret? It
gave him a better insight into the nobility of her
character. She at least was truth itself. She would
prove trustworthy. She was above reproach. He
was doing battle with the old prejudices based on
society codes, as they rose, one by one, to assail his
love.</p>

<p class='c005'>But to do him justice his love wavered not for
one instant. If the setting be tarnished, will that fact
diminish the lustre of the diamond? He knew that
his jewel was of the purest; why should the setting
trouble him? But all was not yet plain to him. He
remembered that night under the maples; when she
had refused him marriage—not love. Love she had
given then as freely as now. He saw it then, he knew
it now. But now again she makes the same refusal.
“You understand now,” she wrote, “why it is that I
cannot marry you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>His noble manhood was all alert now. Does she
think so meanly, so basely of him as to suppose that
he would add to the burden that had so many years
been resting upon those slender shoulders, by withdrawing
his proposal? If that is what she thinks,
her opinion of him is not so exalted as he could wish
and—he must seek her—must see her tonight. With
him to think was to act, and a few minutes later finds
him on the way to the woman of his choice. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>with a dazed feeling that he stood upon the marble
steps awaiting an answer to his ring. What would
be the outcome of this night’s quest?</p>

<p class='c005'>His card again found her at the bedside of the
patient preparing for another long night watch by
herself. Her heart beat high when the little bit of
pasteboard was placed in her hand. Mrs. Boswell
had not yet retired. She saw the flush steal over the
fair brow and an understanding came intuitively to
her as to what it meant. It was not so many years
ago that she too had received a lover’s visit, and she
knew so well that since the illness of Mrs. Westcot
the young girl had no time to spend on friends or
lovers. So she kindly said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go and see your friend. I am not tired tonight
and can well remain several hours longer.” With
an appreciative “Thank you” Imelda accepted the
kind offer and descended to the drawing room, where
but one jet of gas was burning which but dimly lit
the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scarcely had she entered when she felt herself
folded with strong arms to a wildly beating heart.
Lips that whispered, “My own love,” were pressed
firmly to hers. Her heart was full, her bosom heaving.
That he held her thus was ample proof that
to him she was just as lovable now as before he knew
her wretched story. Brushing the soft dusky waves
of hair from the flushed temples, he asked:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will my girl have a little while to spare for me
tonight? I would have you walk with me under the
maples. Will you come?” Without a word she
turned to the hallway and taking a soft white scarf
from a rack, threw it over her shoulders and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, I am ready.” Together they wended
their way to the silver leaved trees where once more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>they paced back and forth, his arm about the graceful
form, his head bent until it rested against hers.
Every attitude betokened the love they bore each
other. O, how he talked, how he plead. But the
slender girl at his side was strong and firm. She
understood the ground she was treading upon. She
met him at every turn.</p>

<p class='c005'>He loved her, and as he listened to her arguments,
as he watched the sparkle of her eye, as he
got a better insight into her life, he felt that here
was indeed a woman of superior qualities, a woman
possessed of rare intellect. And as she met him,
point after point, he began to see things in a different
light. Dim and hazy at first yet still he saw a
difference. Not that he showed an inclination to
acknowledge the truth of any of the pictures she
painted. O, no! not quite so easy are deep-rooted
superstitions and prejudices uprooted. Yet she gave
him food for thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>She pointed out to him conditions as they exist
throughout the country, She showed him how one
vexed question is entangled with another. She drew
his attention to the masses of workers who with their
dollar a day,—sometimes a little more, sometimes
even less,—have no time for self-improvement, no
time for healthful recreation. That recreation
which is of an elevating character, is quite unattainable
and that which is within their reach is of the
most demoralizing kind. The swilling of vile drinks,
with vile companions in dens still more vile.</p>

<p class='c005'>She spoke of the overburdened wife and mother,
wearing away her life in drudgery and loneliness.
At the close of his day’s toil the husband brings no
love to the cheerless home. That which he had
named and believed love on their wedding day has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>long since fled; yet of this union springs unwishedfor
children; children gestated in an atmosphere of
hate; idiots and criminals ushered into being to fill
our prisons and insane asylums. The employer class,
on the other hand, feast upon the wealth these unfortunates
produce, and by their excesses sow the
seeds of crime in their offspring.</p>

<p class='c005'>“On all sides,” said Imelda, “through the force
of circumstances young lives are lost in the sloughs
of vice and shame. Woman sells her virtue to the
highest bidder; the one for a passing hour, the other
for a life time. Which of the two is the worse?
The merciless and unnatural codes of society demand
the unsexing of woman by strangling nature’s desires,
then these codes permit one man to drive her to the
grave or to the mad house through the power given
to him by the law. The woman that would be true
to her normal instincts, the woman that would practicalize
her natural right of being a mother, must
first sell herself for all time to some man, who, in
return, forces upon her what at first was a pleasure
and a blessing but now a hundred-fold curse. To
surrender herself in love with holiest emotions is a
sin, is a demoralization. To endure the hated embrace
of the man who long since murdered every
trace of that holy love, is a duty and virtue.</p>

<p class='c005'>“To escape such thralldom is to her an utter
impossibility, as the only way out lies through that
most damnable of abominations, the divorce court,
where every pure instinct of a sensitive woman’s nature
is outraged to such extent that generally she
prefers, of the two evils, the marital outrage to that
of the divorce court.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And yet the world goes on. Ignorant mothers
bear and rear ignorant children. From their birth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>nature is strangled. They are fed and clothed in an
unhealthful, unnatural manner, so that the wonder
is, not that there are so many small graves but
rather that so many survive. The little girl with
propensities to romp is told she is a hoyden, a tomboy.
The boy with refined sentiments, that he is a
‘sissy,’ and so on throughout the long category.
We are bound, fettered, on all sides from the cradle
to the grave. No matter what misery, what woe,
springs therefrom, never go your own way but
travel only that which is mapped out for you by custom
which has been foisted upon society. O, it is so
unnatural, so miserable, this binding, this fettering,
this laying down laws that are made only to be
broken.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She had spoken rapidly, and had warmed in her
enthusiasm. Her head thrown slightly backward
with a motion most graceful, her eyes shining with a
glory that was beautiful, and Norman did not fail to
be struck by it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How can it all affect us, my sweet?” he asked.
“Are we not far above all the horrible pictures you
have drawn?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope so,” she answered. “I do, indeed,
hope we are above it, but don’t you see every picture
has its ground work in the ‘Thou shalt not,’ of some
law? Every picture has its clanking chains and the
heaviest is always the marriage chain. Don’t you
see, don’t you understand?” He folded her close in
his arms, an action which she by no means resented.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And must our sweet love be sacrificed because of
those horrible conditions? Have you not more faith
in the voice of your heart?” Tears sprang to her
eyes. O, how hard it was to steel that heart to the
pleadings of the precious voice. How could she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>make him understand that he possessed the unbounded
trust, the most unconditional love of her whole being?</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have all the faith in the world in you,” she
said, as with trembling fingers she caressed the fair
locks that fell in clustering masses over the open
noble brow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can you not see, can you not understand that
I love you with all the strength of my being? Let
us be happy now, in the present, in that love, and
trust to the future to lift the veil, to dispel the
clouds,”—and he could not dissuade her. He kissed
the tears from the shining dark eyes. His love for
her grew with every hour. He realized that bitter
suffering in the past had sown the seed of the present
strength of character and growth of views to which
until now he had given but a passing thought.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>But now? One thing Imelda had achieved. She
had led Norman into the realms of thought. She
had made him think as he had never thought before.
He now began to see the real cause of human misery.
Asking a few well directed questions he soon had the
missing links needed to supplement Imelda’s life
history. She told him of the fair-haired girl whom
she loved better than a sister; the girl whose mother’s
life had been blighted through that self-same marriage
curse. She told him of that cherished friend
who through the same curse had seen a worshiped
mother laid beneath the sod—which tale she ended
by requesting him to write those friends; to become
acquainted with them; to test their friendship. Norman
agreed to do this, and not many days later a
letter of his was speeding across the prairies bearing
his worded desire to know better those who had in
earlier days befriended his Imelda, and who wielded
such influence over her.</p>

<p class='c005'>But to those enthralled in love’s golden fetters
time speeds on rapid wings. When Norman looked
at his watch he found it pointing to half past ten.
A pang smote Imelda’s heart as she thought of the
lonely watcher up in the sick chamber, and hastily
sought to disengage herself from the encircling arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>of her lover. A half dozen more love-laden kisses
and the young girl was bounding across the open
grounds followed by the fond eyes of her lover who
watched her until she disappeared within the portals
of the house ere he wended his way homeward.</p>

<p class='c005'>No sooner had Imelda stepped into the hall,
softly closing the door behind her, than, from the
open door to the right, leading into the drawing
room, stepped Lawrence Westcot. Imelda drew
back. She did not care to encounter anyone just
now, least of all Lawrence Westcot. Planting himself
directly across her path, but speaking with faultless
courtesy he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Ellwood will you grant me the favor of
a few moments conversation?” at the same time
holding open the door for her to pass through.
Imelda paused, hesitating. What could Lawrence
Westcot desire to say to her? Besides it was already
late. Her conscience smote her for having absented
herself so long from the sick room, and she certainly
felt no desire to be alone with this man at this
hour of the evening. But he was waiting, holding
the door for her to pass through, quite as a matter
of course. Much as she was disinclined to do so she
yet felt that she could not refuse without appearing
rude, and so, reluctantly passing him she entered the
room, while he closed the door after them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The room was dimly lit, as before when she had
entered it earlier in the evening. Imelda paused
under the single burning jet. He came forward and
turned it to a brighter blaze, then wheeled forward a
chair for her to be seated, but which she declined,
shaking her head in a positive manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beg your pardon, but I would rather not,
Mr. Westcot. It is time I return to Alice. Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Boswell kindly relieved me this evening of several
hours of responsibility. I have already overstayed
my time. I do not wish to give it the appearance of
an imposition, so if you have anything to say to me I
must beg of you to hasten.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She had taken a step or two backward and stood
with her hand resting upon the back of the chair
Westcot had placed for her, the soft folds of the
white shawl that had been loosely thrown over her
head and shoulders, the glow of health and happiness
upon her cheek and in the dark brown eyes—Lawrence
Westcot felt the magic beauty of the picture
before him. It was doubtful if he heard a word of
what she had spoken; certain it was that he paid no
attention to it. Suddenly Imelda became conscious
of his burning gaze, and in a moment her face was
dyed from brow to chin with a hot wave of color,
and again she spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you have something to tell me, Mr. Westcot,
will you please do so without loss of time? I do not
wish that Alice should be waiting.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let her wait,” he said hastily, huskily. “She
is not wanting for anything. I have just come from
there. Mrs. Boswell is with her and can manage
very well. Besides, why should you make such a
prisoner of yourself? The nurse is paid for her
work; let her do it. A little while longer will not
hurt her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Utterly surprised, Imelda for the moment was
unable to speak, but almost instantly recovering her
self-possession:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Was it to tell me this you have asked me to
come in here?” He heeded not the withering
scorn in her voice, but stepping nearer he possessed
himself of one of her hands.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“Why should I not tell you that, and a great
deal more if I choose? True, you never gave me a
chance, but can you not see that I madly love you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sir! You forget yourself!” Imelda snatched
her hand from him and stepped several paces backward.
Nothing daunted the next moment he again
was at her side.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why should I not tell you, and why should
you not listen? Do I not know your views on love
and marriage? According to them you cannot deem
my love for you a crime because I am a married
man.” With these words he attempted again to take
her hand, but she, by mustering all her strength
pushed him from her with such force as to almost
unbalance him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How dare you?” she articulated. The face
that only a few moments ago was dyed scarlet was
now ashen in its pallor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dare it because I love you,” came in low,
almost hissing tones from lips that were now pale as
hers, while his black eyes glowed like living coals.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you think I will meekly surrender you to
that—no! I will not call names—to that so-called
friend of mine? I tell you no! a thousand times no!
I acknowledge no barriers, as I know you do not,
and I swear to you that you must and shall be mine!”—and
ere Imelda was aware of his intention he had
gained her side, his arms like bands of iron were laid
about her shoulders, and the next instant she felt his
hated kisses upon her lips. For a moment she was
powerless, and only for a moment, when with
strength of desperation she tore herself from his
embrace.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are the most despicable creature upon this
earth! I will tell you what barriers stand between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>us. First and foremost your utter lack of manhood.
By whatever despicable means you may have obtained
an inkling of my views, let me tell you that
you have failed, utterly failed to get the least gleaming
of the truth. Know that a creature so wholly
devoid of principle and honor may never hope to win
the favor of a free woman. Know you that love can
neither be forced nor bought. When you come to
realize and understand this you may speak to me
again—not until then.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With an imperious movement she swept by him,
leaving him bewildered and, for a moment, totally
subdued. Had he failed to understand her? What
a glorious creature! and what superb scorn. Did she
know what stood between Alice and him? At the
thought of Alice a dark frown swept over his face.
What was the meaning of that?</p>

<p class='c005'>Upon winged feet Imelda flew up the broad
stairway and into the sick room. Her strength was
at an end. Staggering she would have fallen, had
not the nurse seen her condition in time and caught
her in her arms. Carefully she laid her upon the
lounge. Alice was sleeping, as indeed the last few
days and nights she had slept almost constantly,
which fact enabled the nurse to pay all her attention
for the next half hour to this new patient. Finally
Imelda returned to consciousness, but only to break
into an uncontrollable fit of weeping. For a little
while the nurse permitted this fit to have full sway,
but when the storm had spent itself and Imelda became
more composed she stepped to the stand where
there was quite an array of medicines. Mixing a
soothing draught she handing it to Imelda, saying:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take this,” and, quite as a matter of course
Imelda drank the cooling drink.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“Now,” continued Mrs. Boswell, “go to your
room and lie down.” But this time she was not so
readily obeyed. Imelda’s frame shook as with a chill.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I would rather not. Please let me remain
where I am. I shall soon recover and be all right
again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No! no! the sick room is no place to sleep. I
insist that you go to your own room and bed, if you
would avoid being sick yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Imelda on no account would have traversed
the lonely hallway again tonight, for fear of meeting
in some shadowy nook the man she had just left below
in such a storm of passion. Mrs. Boswell soon
realized that for some unaccountable reason Imelda
seemed afraid, though this was a weakness she had
not hitherto noticed in the girl, but she understood
too well that she was in need of perfect composure
and rest, and the sick room was no place for these.
Stepping to the bedside of the sleeping patient she
bent over her and listened for a moment to the quiet
breathing; then she said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, I will go with you. It will be perfectly
safe to leave our patient for a few moments.” Then
taking the agitated girl by the hand, she led her
through the hallway to her own room. Lighting the
gas jet she next turned down the bed clothes and
quietly but quickly assisted her to disrobe and
helped her into the snowy night robe. She would
then have tucked her into her bed but Imelda refused,
as she wished to fasten the door after the retreating
form of the nurse, who thereupon returned
to the bedside of the sleeping Alice to watch the
night away when she herself had expected to spend
it in needed rest and sleep.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Since recording the events of the last chapter,
weeks of summer sunshine have passed away. Alice,
dressed in a soft fleecy white cashmere wrapper, is
reclining in her own cozy room, upon a comfortable
lounge which has been drawn closely to the open
window from where she can watch the golden rays
of the setting sun as it disappears beyond the distant
hills. Pale and wan she looks, but the sparkle of
returning health is in her eyes as they rest now and
then upon the forms of her two little girls who are
seated in childish fashion upon the floor, and with
their baby fingers trying to wind wreaths of ferns
and flowers that are heaped in a low basket that
has been placed with its contents at their disposal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda in one of her soft gray gowns was seated
in a low rocker. The book from which she had been
reading was lying unnoticed in her lap; her eyes, too,
were wandering through the open window to enjoy
the golden glory of the setting sun. For a while
nothing was heard but childish voices in childish glee.
Both fair women were busy with their own thoughts.
Imelda had lost some of her wild-rose bloom. The
clear-cut features were almost colorless as marble.
There was a constrained look upon them; yet now and
then they would brighten as with an inward light,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and reflect the happiness that she, in those moments,
felt; but they soon gave way again to that other look,
a deep sigh betokening the change of thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the last rays of the sun died out in a golden
halo, Alice slowly turned her head and for a while
lay watching her friend. “A penny for your
thoughts, my dear,” she said with a smile, thus recalling
her to present things.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They are not worth it,” Imelda made answer.
“They are but vague and unreal dreams.” Alice’s
pale face quivered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Vague and unreal,” she repeated. “Ah, my
precious, as long as they are vague and unreal, you
may count yourself happy. It is the real and tangible
that makes life a burden. Why have I returned
to it? I am sure I would have been many times better
off had they laid me beneath the green sods.” A
pitiful quiver was in the sad young voice, and Imelda
felt a sudden pain at her heart as she heard and understood.
The next moment she knelt at the side of
the invalid.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why should you talk like that? See, that is
why you should be here,” pointing to the little ones.
Little Norma was laughing and clapping her chubby
hands. She had just succeeded in crowning, with
the work of their childish hands, the elder and more
stately Meta who was attempting a dignified mien
under the high honors. The dark-eyed elf looked so
comic that Alice could not repress a smile even
though a tear trickled over the pale face. Just then
a step in the hallway was heard, and the next moment
a figure stood in the open doorway.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa! papa!” Norma’s baby voice rang out,
and the next instant the little one flew to meet him.
He stooped and lifted the flaxen-haired child to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>arms. The baby arms were twined about his neck.
But little Norma’s welcome seemed the only one that
was accorded him; even Meta hung back, shy and
quiet. She walked backwards to where the fair
young mother lay, who clasped the child to her fast
beating heart. Imelda rose quickly from her kneeling
position and stepping to the open window turned
her back to the other inmates of the room. Lawrence
Westcot saw and understood. For just one
moment his black eyes emitted a flash like a smouldering
flame and his white teeth sank deep into his
nether lip. But not one word passed those lips that
would have betrayed what was taking place underneath
the quiet exterior. He had not seen Imelda
since that night three weeks ago, when his words
had been like cruel blows to the pure, proud girl.
She had managed to keep out of his sight, and he did
not possess the courage or daring to force himself
into her presence. This lack of courage kept him
also from the sick room of his wife, which was probably
most fortunate for her chances of recovery.
Never once, since her return to consciousness, had
her eyes rested upon his face. If she missed him it
certainly did not cause regret. It is more likely,
however, that she did not think of him at all, in those
days.</p>

<p class='c005'>Certain it was that when he suddenly stood, unannounced,
in her presence her heart gave a great
bound and then seemed to stand still. Could she
have thought that he would never come near her
again? But the silence was now becoming oppressive.
Not a word from anyone only little Norma’s
cooing, caressing—“Papa, papa,” as the little hands
patted the dark inscrutable face. With the little one
still in his arms he took several steps forward toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the frightened little woman seated upon the
lounge. With a start and a gasp she drew Meta
with one arm still closer to her, while the other hand
was uplifted in a manner intended to wave him off.
Seeing the gesture he instantly stopped. An indescribable
look passed over his face. Could it be pain?
He hesitated a moment, then kissed the baby face
and set little Norma down.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa is not wanted here,” he said in a tone that
sent a strange thrill to the heart of either woman.
Was it the same voice they were wont to hear? No
sneer, no sarcasm. How husky it had become! Did
it not sound like regret? Ere they could recover
from their surprise he was gone and they were once
more alone. The excitement that those few minutes
had brought had been too much for Alice. The next
moment she was sobbing hysterically, and for the
next half hour Imelda had her hands full in trying to
restore quiet and peace. For seeing the mother
weep caused both little girls to fling their playthings
aside in true childish fashion and join with their tears.
Alice was still very weak, or this episode could
scarcely have affected her as it did; and to do Lawrence
Westcot justice, he had no intention of inflicting
pain when he went to his wife’s room that evening.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nevertheless Imelda felt bitter as she reflected
what life must mean to this timid, nervous little
woman when the mere sight of the man to whom she
was bound could throw her into such a hysterical
state. O, how wrong it all was, how wrong! After
a while, however, she became more quiet and at
Imelda’s suggestion she soon retired. Imelda mixed
for her a soothing drink and soon had the satisfaction
of hearing the even, regular breathing of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>sleeper. Long ere this she had sent both little girls
away with their nurse, so she had the hours of the
summer evening to herself. It was quite warm, the
evening shadows were deepening, and following an
inward prompting she soon found herself in the
garden walks, wending her way to the fountain.
This was a favorite place with her. Its cooling
spray was so pleasant after the oppressive heat of
the day. She dipped her hand into the cooling liquid
while her thought strayed away to distant friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>The evening before she had spent in the society
of Norman, who had that day received a second letter
from Wilbur Wallace. He had expressed himself
well pleased with the tenor of those letters as they
showed to him the writer as in a mirror of light, and
of whose character he was forming a high opinion,
even though he could not yet second all the ideas
placed before him for inspection. Yet, although he
found these ideas impracticable in the extreme, as he
expressed it, he could not but pronounce them exalted
and pure, beyond those of men in general.
Imelda longed to see these two men friends, and the
prospects were that her wish would be gratified.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another thing that had proved of interest to
Norman was that Harrisburg had been the early
home of Wilbur Wallace, the discovery of which fact
was as much a surprise to Imelda as to Norman, as
he had never made mention thereof. He gave as a
reason for not having done so that the place held
little of that which was pleasant to his recollection.
It was beneath the waves of the Susquehanna that his
mother had found her watery grave, and if it were
not that his sisters still lived there he would have
been glad to forget that there was such a place. But,
he had gone on to say, in his last letter to Imelda:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“Since you, my precious friend, have made
your home in Harrisburg, I have often desired to tell
you that my idolized Edith, who is the eldest, and the
equally precious younger sister, my sweet Hilda, are
living somewhere at no great distance from your
present home. So many years have passed since I
have seen them that they have grown almost strangers
to me. Do you think you could take interest in
them sufficient to visit them in my name? Both dear
girls often send me long and affectionate letters,
wherein they tell their ‘stranger’ brother all about
their girlish affairs, and if there is any saving virtue
in thoughts transferred to paper I may hope to keep
those blessed souls pure and unstained through the
strength of the love that they bear me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Could she be sufficiently interested in them?”
Imelda smiled as her heart warmed to those unknown
girls. She would love them as sisters of her own.
Had she known she would long since have hastened to
meet them; now she must wait a little while longer
until Alice would be stronger, so that she could
either leave her or persuade her to come with her.
She thought of them this evening as she playfully
let the water run through her fingers. In her mind
she pictured the meeting with them and then she
thought of the report she should send Wilbur, and
then her thoughts strayed away to her own wayward
sister, of whom she had never again heard so much
as one single word, or received one sign of life. She
did not know if she was still among the living.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda’s heart grew warm and yet sad. What
had become of Cora? To what depths had she sunk?
or had there been enough latent good hidden somewhere
in her character to once more extricate herself
and rise to higher ground? “Cora, O Cora! where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>are you to night? Don’t you know your sister loves
you?” and as if in answer to the prayerfully spoken
words a voice at her side low and intense spoke her
name. “Imelda!” As though the voice had struck
her speechless, she stood with stiffening white lips
unable to move or speak until her name was repeated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Imelda!” Then——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Frank!” broke from them in a husky whisper.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Frank! You? Where did you come from?”
turning to the form that from the darkness had stepped
to her side. The old reckless laugh rang upon
the still night air:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not afraid of me, sister mine, are you? I
have come from somewhere out of the darkness surrounding
us, but I am not dangerous. I have never
done anything worse than steal when I was hungry;
but as that happens on an average about twice, sometimes
thrice a day I have that unpleasant duty rather
often to perform. But what is a fellow to do? The
world owes me a living, you know, and exerting myself
to the extent of taking something wherever I can
place my hand upon it is about as much work as I care
to do.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Say sis,” he went on in his reckless manner, to
the horror-struck girl, “you couldn’t give a fellow a
little spending money, now could you? You are in a
pretty feathered nest here, you must admit. I always
knew and said such saintly goodness and beauty
must have their reward. I knew too you were not
quite so innocent as you would have us believe. Say,
now, honor bright, how much is this most honored
brother-in-law of mine worth? To judge from the
appearance of yonder noble mansion and these surrounding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>grounds, he must command more than a
few thousands, and as I would like to put in an appearance
at your next grand entertainment a few
hundred would not come amiss. You would not like
to be ashamed of me, eh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Almost paralyzed with horror Imelda listened.
Was this man, who was scarcely more than a boy,
her brother? Oh, shame, shame! Her brother,
born of the same mother! She understood. He
thought she was married and he asked her for some
of that supposed husband’s money. Was it possible
that the man sleeping in his far western grave was
the father of them both?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, ’Melda, can’t you give a fellow an answer?
I am waiting patiently. Gad, but you have
managed nicely. It seems I struck it handsome
when the brakeman found me snuggled away in a
freight car, the other night, and insisted that my
room at that particular place was more welcome
than my presence. Think I shall remain here, instead
of playing tramp any longer. It will certainly
be a change. Only I suppose I can’t present myself
in my present plight at the front door of my illustrious
brother-in-law’s mansion. So, sis, you will
have to fork over some of the shiners so’s I can
make the desired change.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Frank!” now broke in Imelda’s horror-struck
voice. “Frank! Will you stop? How dare you
think any of all the terrible things you have been
saying? You seem to take it for granted because
you find me here in the grounds of a handsome home
that it is my own. I am not married, as you seem
to think, but am only a servant in the house you see
yonder. So you see all your talk about a rich brother-in-law
is the veriest nonsense, and the sooner you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>leave here and find yourself some honest work to do
the better it will be for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, ’Melda,” he cried, catching her
roughly by the arm, “you can’t come any such chaff
over me! I want money! I know you have it, and
I swear you are going to give it to me.” Imelda felt
the blood in her veins turning to ice, not from fear,
but from the horror that her brother had come to a
level such as this.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let go of my arm,” she said in a calm, even
voice. “Have you ever known me to speak a falsehood?
I have no money, and what is more, if I had
I should not give you a cent. You know me well
enough of old to know that I never say what I do not
mean; so I repeat, let go of my arm and leave these
premises as quickly as possible. Until the time that
you can prove yourself a man I forbid you ever to
speak to me again. Go to the home of our childhood
and at the graves of those to whom you owe your
being, make the resolution that you will be a son
worthy of your father, and if you can keep that
resolution a time may come in the future that you
may again call me sister. Now for the last time,
go,”—saying which she brushed his hand from her
arm and turning walked quickly away.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had not proceeded a dozen steps when she
ran into the arms of someone standing there in the
darkness. A cry broke from her lips. She was almost
overcome with terror. Were the grounds infested
tonight? Her heart throbbed with such force
it seemed she would suffocate. She could not utter
a sound. Who was it? She only heard a heavy
breathing and on trying to extricate her hands they
were held tighter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t fear,” spoke a voice which sent a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>thrill of fear to her heart, for it was the voice of
Lawrence Westcot!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t fear, you are quite safe. I have heard
the greater part of what transpired a few steps from
here, and I will walk with you to the house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda was too weak to protest much against
this offer. She shivered as he drew her arm through
his and led her silently to the house, but in spite of
her terror and repugnance at his touch she could not
but notice that he treated her with profound respect.
He led her to the entrance, opened the door and held
it for her to pass through.</p>

<p class='c005'>Without a single word she left him. Scarcely
able to keep on her feet she dragged herself up the
broad stairway to her room; then without removing
any of her clothing, she sank upon the bed whereon
she lay long hours without moving so much as a
finger. As the morning dawn stole through the windows
she rose and disrobed, a storm of sobs shaking
the slender figure while tears bedewed her pillow.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the following day, and on many following
days it was difficult to say which of the two, Alice or
Imelda, was the paler, the more listless; whether in
the depths of the blue or brown eyes lay hidden the
keenest pain.</p>

<p class='c005'>Norman came and went. He saw the change in
the girl he loved but could not fathom the cause. He
asked if she were sick; a shake of the head was the
only answer. It was all she could do to restrain the
tears in his presence. It would have been a luxury
to sob her unhappy story out upon his breast, but
shame sealed her lips. So she bore her sorrow as
best she could, and in time its keen edge wore off.
Frank seemed to have disappeared as suddenly and
completely as he did once before. Now and then, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the memory of that evening more vividly rose before
her mind’s eye, she would whisper to herself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O father! my ever dear father! how thankful I
am you did not live to realize all this. How thankful
that your proud head has not been bowed with
shame such knowledge would have brought you,”—and
as these thoughts seemed to give new strength
her own head would be uplifted, while a look of pride
could be read in that high-bred face.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The events recorded in the last chapter had for
a while caused to be forced into the background the
desire in Imelda’s heart to become acquainted with
the sisters of Wilbur. The affair with Frank was
of a nature so unpleasant that the remembrance of
it seemed to crush out all youth and life in the proud
sensitive heart, but as time is wont to heal all wounds
so also did the effect of that dark night’s occurrence
gradually vanish. As the days and weeks went by
on the ceaseless wings of time Imelda again became
interested in what was going on around her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Toward evening of a sunny day in August when
Alice had been feeling better, brighter and stronger
than usual she expressed the desire for a drive. Accordingly
the carriage was ordered. Both little girls,
sweet as snowy blossoms, in fresh white dresses,
looking dainty and charming as two little fairies,
were lifted upon one of the seats, their lively spirits
keeping busy the hands and mind of their young
governess. Alice leaned languidly back among the
cushions and let her eyes rest alternately upon the
glowing landscape and upon the two restless little
elves. As it had been quite a while since they had
the pleasure of driving with their pretty mamma it
was really a treat for the little ones—this driving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>past pretty gardens filled with gorgeous flowers and
trees laden with ripening fruit. Soon they were
passing through the more thronged streets when
suddenly,—no one knew just how it happened but
some boys were playing in the streets. Either in
their play or because they had been quarreling
among themselves a stone was thrown. Then followed
a plunge and a rear of one of the horses, a
piercing scream from the inmates of the carriage,
and then horses and carriage went plunging down
one of the busiest streets—the flying figure of a
woman as she hastened to get out of the way—a horrified
cry at her having been run down—the figure of
a man standing in the path of the runaways, a firm
hand grasping the reins of the beasts as with an effort
almost superhuman they were brought to a standstill.
Snorting, trembling, restive, it was no easy
matter to hold them, but the young man with the almost
boyish face was equal to the task. A crowd
soon gathered around. The carriage door was
opened and the frightened ladies and children lifted
therefrom. Alice could scarcely keep upon her feet.
Just then it was remarked that someone had been run
over and injured,—a young girl, someone else added.
At hearing this Alice would have fallen had not
Imelda caught the swaying figure in her arms.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,” she cried, “I hope she is not killed or
seriously injured. We must find out who she is and
how badly she has been hurt, and—oh, wait! Where
is the young man who so bravely rescued us, periling
his own life to save ours. Where is he? Who is he?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Upon looking round they found that he was still
holding the horses, patting and coaxing them, speaking
to them as if they were intelligent beings, while
the driver was also busy trying to pacify them. Upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>request someone spoke to the young stranger,
telling him that the ladies whom he had just rescued
wished to speak to him. A comic grimace for a moment
distorted the handsome face, then a merry
smile played about the ripe red lips, then quickly
stepping to the sidewalk, he dropped his hat and
bowing asked if he could be of any further service.
As he stood with uncovered head awaiting the pleasure
of the ladies a sensation flashed through Imelda’s
mind that somewhere she had seen this face before.
The poise of the head, a trick of the hand, even the
very smile playing about the lips seemed familiar,
but she found it impossible to place the resemblance.
Alice in the old impulsive manner held out both
small white hands to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will permit me to thank you, will you not,
for the service you have done us today? But for
your bravery we might all have been killed.” The
boyish face dimpled all over with sunny smiles, as he
tossed the fair hair from the heated and damp brow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beg your pardon lady, but I think almost
anyone would have done as much. It was not so
wonderful a thing for me to do. I am used to the
handling of horses, it was only a spicy adventure,
that is all, and if I thereby was of any important
service, why, I am only too glad, I can assure you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But will you not give us your name? I want
to know to whom I am indebted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>During all this time Imelda was studying the
youthful face of this stalwart young stranger.
Where had she seen that face, or one like it? Meta
was clinging to her skirts, her great dark eyes staring
at the handsome boy, for he really was little
more than that. Little Norma was clinging to her
mother and was still sobbing in childish fright.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Ignoring the question of the young mother the young
man laid his hand upon the head of the sobbing little
one, which action hushed the sobs, while she lifted
her blue eyes in wonderment to the smiling face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind, little pet,” said he, “when you
are a young lady you will have forgotten all about
the naughty fright you have had today. Don’t you
think so, little Dark Eyes?”</p>

<p class='c005'>This last to Meta who never for a moment had
let her shining dark orbs wander from the fair face
of the young rescuer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know,” was the naive answer the sweet
childish voice made, which provoked a merry peal of
laughter from the boyish lips. Alice too was smiling
now, but if he thought to divert her thoughts
from the question she had asked he was mistaken,
for as soon as she could again recall his attention she
repeated the request.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well now,” the young man replied in a hesitating
manner, “I really have not done anything worth
mentioning, and——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please,” interrupted Alice. “I want so much
to know. As an additional favor I ask it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, then,” he answered with a sort of
desperation, at the same time hunting in the depths
of his pockets and fishing therefrom a bit of pasteboard.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe my name is scrawled on this. If that
is of any value to you, you are certainly welcome to
it,” and with that he handed her the little white card.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Osmond Leland,” Alice read. Like an electric
shock did the words thrill Imelda. Her hand caught
the arm of her friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the name? Read it again. I fear I
have not heard aright.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Osmond Leland,” repeated Alice. “I am sure
that is the name written very plainly,” and she
handed the card to Imelda. The young man began
to look with surprise at the beautiful agitated
face of the lady who seemed to find something queer
about his name. She turned to him with a quick
imperious movement. All in an instant she knew
why his face seemed familiar.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Leland, but have you
not a sister?” A flush slowly mounted his brow,
even to the roots of his hair. The surprised look in
his face deepened. Who was this lady that she
should ask him such a question?</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe I have a sister. Yes, but how could
you know of this?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Her name is Margaret?” entirely ignoring the
latter part of the young man’s answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe that is her name,” he again answered
becoming still more mystified.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And her home is in Chicago, where she lives
with your mother?” Again the flush mounted to
his brow. There was a little stiffening of the lines
about the mouth as he answered somewhat coldly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She lives in Chicago with her mother,” placing
a marked emphasis upon the “her.” Imelda noticed
it and a pained look crept about her lips. She hesitated,
scarcely knowing how to proceed. Alice was
watching her. Quickly she understood that the
young man who had rendered them such signal service
must be the brother of the precious friend of
Imelda, whom she herself had learned to love in the
short time she had known her, for her own sake.
Imelda had told her all the sad story. The boy had
been many years under the influence of that worthless
father. Had he instilled the poison into his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>heart? It would almost seem so. How would Imelda
proceed? She seemed to hesitate for a few moments,
then suddenly,—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I left Chicago only a few months ago. Margaret
Leland was my most precious friend in that
great city. A woman pure as pure gold; reared, instructed
and cared for by her mother whose life is
consecrated to truth and purity. Margaret Leland
and her mother are women whom any man in the
land might well be proud to own as sister and
mother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda had spoken quickly, her words savoring
just a little of excitement. They sounded like a
defense, with just an undercurrent of pleading for
justice for those loved ones, to one whom fate had
placed in a position where he was ignorant of that
which ought to concern him most in life. He seemed
to understand her desire. After a slight hesitation,
his embarrassment growing greater every moment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If the ladies will kindly permit I would be
thankful to avail myself of the permission to call
upon them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda reached out her hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I would be so pleased. I will have much to
tell you.” Alice, in her turn, hastened to express
her pleasure, giving him her card, and while she
clasped his hand in both of hers she gave him, as a
parting salutation:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do not forget or hesitate to come. I, too,
know both sweet ladies referred to. Let me assure
you they are ladies, pure and good.” Then giving
her driver orders to wait she again spoke to young
Leland, telling him that they were anxious to ascertain
the truth of what they had heard, that a young
girl had been injured; whereupon he offered to accompany
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>them. They retraced their steps the distance
of a square, where they found quite a number
of people gathered who were discussing the accident.
Upon inquiring they found that the girl had been
picked up bleeding and in an insensible condition,
but that before she could be taken to a hospital a
young lady, opposite whose home the accident had
occurred and who had just returned from shopping,
had opened her hospitable door and had cared for
the wounded girl. Some bystanders remarked that
in all probability her kind action would not meet the
approval of her father, or that of her stepmother.
But Miss Wallace, it was replied, had a mind of her
own, and usually she followed its dictates. The
house was pointed out to Alice and Imelda, and to
judge from the outward appearance it was by no
means the abode of poverty. Mounting the steps
they rang the bell. Upon stating their errand, they
were asked to enter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Young Leland here bade them farewell for the
present, promising them soon to call at the home of
the Westcots. The anxious ladies were then shown
into the parlor and left to themselves. They could
hear that there was a commotion of some kind.
There were hasty steps to and fro; voices in the distance;
orders given, etc. After a while the door
opened and a beautiful dark eyed young lady entered.
In a voice full and rich she said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“If I have been rightly informed, you ladies
were in the carriage that dashed over the unfortunate
girl who has been hurt?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Both ladies had risen.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes! to our great sorrow, such is the case,”
said Alice. “Some boys were throwing stones and
hitting one of our horses caused the sad accident.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“And were none of you hurt?” looking from
one to the other and from them to the little ones.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, thank you; not hurt at all. We escaped
with only a terrible fright, but the unfortunate young
girl,—who is she? Is she seriously injured?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who she is we have as yet no means of ascertaining
as she is still unconscious. From appearance
she is a working girl; she is very plainly dressed,
but there are evident marks of refinement, as though
she might have seen better days. How seriously she is
hurt we also do not know. As I have said before, she
has not yet regained consciousness. We know, however,
that she has been hurt about the head. An
arm also is broken, but the doctor hopes she is not
inwardly injured. She seems to be in a weak condition
of body as from recent illness. I have left my
sister in charge while I came to you, ladies, so as not
to leave you too long in suspense.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was evident the fair speaker was desirous that
her callers would take their leave, as her attention
was doubtless required somewhere else. Imelda had
not spoken. She experienced again the same sensations
that she had when she first saw young Leland.
Again the face before her seemed strangely familiar,
but she was unable to place it. Was it to be a repetition
of her former experience of an hour ago?
But how? Alice was in the act of leave-taking, giving
minute instructions as to her place of residence
in case of an unlooked-for development of the case,
for she said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I feel as though we are in a measure responsible
for the sad accident, and I shall want to know if
there are any serious results.” Ere the young lady
could give an answer Imelda could no longer resist
the impulse to speak what was in her mind. Laying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>her hand upon that of the beautiful stranger.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beg your pardon,” she said, “but will you
kindly tell me with whom I have the honor of speaking?
I do so much want to know your name.” The
great dark eyes sparkled as she answered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“The favor you ask is but a small one indeed,
and easily granted. My name is Edith Wallace.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Edith Wallace!” echoed Imelda. “Are you
a sister of Wilbur Wallace?”</p>

<p class='c005'>For a moment a look of surprise rested on the
face of Miss Wallace; then,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it possible! can it be Imelda Ellwood?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am Imelda Ellwood.” In a moment the
hands of both fair girls were joined in a firm clasp
and, as if drawn together by a strange magnetism,
their lips also met.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wilbur has told me all about you, but as he
did not send me your address, my sister and I had to
wait patiently for you to come to us. And this, I
suppose,” turning again to Alice, “is the lady with
whom you make your home?” An introduction followed
and instead of dismissing the two, Miss Wallace
now insisted that they should remain awhile longer.
“That is,” she added, “if you can pardon my seeming
neglect, as my attention will have to be a divided
one. My sister Hilda is with the patient and the
doctor at present and to them I must soon return.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take me with you,” pleaded Imelda. “I have
had a great deal of experience with the sick and
maybe shall be able to be of some help to you. Besides,
I feel curious to see this girl. I feel somewhat
guilty as to the cause of her suffering, although
we were the unconscious and unwilling cause. Yet I
feel we owe her more than the wornout phrase, ‘I
am sorry!’”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Protesting yet consenting, Edith after having
again excused herself to Alice, who was by this time
reclining in a large easy chair, and having supplied
the little ones with a charming picture book, she led
the way. Leading her guest up a softly carpeted
flight of stairs she noiselessly opened the door into a
large airy chamber furnished in light refreshing
tints. Snow-white curtains draped the windows
while the bright light was toned to a mellow glow by
wine-colored blinds.</p>

<p class='c005'>A sweet-faced young girl was sitting at the side
of the snowy draped bed, watching the pale face on
the pillows. So intent was she that she never turned
her head at the entrance of the new comers, thinking
it was her sister alone that was returning. The light
brown hair was a struggling mass of curls that, although
brushed and combed, constantly escaped from
their confinement. The face was almost colorless,
the brow rather low, and the eyes a deep, dark gray.
Tender, loving, with a full share of animal spirits,
Hilda Wallace was loved wherever she went. Not
quite so beautiful as the elder sister, Edith, she was
just as attractive in her way.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the one quick glance Imelda gave her she understood
her fully. Before the watcher and obstructing
the view, stood the doctor with the forefinger of
his right hand resting upon the wrist of the girl’s left
and uninjured hand. With his left hand holding his
watch he was counting the pulse beats. At the foot
of the bed stood a woman of about forty years, apparently
the housekeeper. Her eyes were bent as intently
upon the quiet form as those of the others in
the room. Edith stepped up to her and for a few
moments whispered in her ear. Nodding assent and
softly tiptoeing the housekeeper slipped from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>room. Edith gently moved around to the other side
of the bed and bending over the sufferer listened to
the almost imperceptible breathing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How is she, doctor? Do you apprehend any
danger?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The man of science shook his head. “Not immediately,”
he said, “but she will require careful
nursing. She has an ugly cut upon the head and we
will have to prevent inflammation or brain fever
may set in. It is important to keep her head cool.
Do not forget to change the ice bandage every few
minutes. The broken arm is nothing serious in itself
and will soon be all right, but it may add to the fever
the first two or three days. She ought to have been
taken to a hospital instantly. I am afraid it may be
some time now before she can be removed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is not to be considered,” said Edith.
“We have room enough and also willing hands that
it will do good to get some practice in the art of
relieving pain, and if it should prove necessary we
can call in the help of a professional nurse. But I
wish I knew who she is. I am sure her friends must
be very anxious about her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The doctor merely nodded his head in a grave
manner, giving vent to some very expressive grunts.
“Very well,” he said, “very well; if you are so
willing I am sure I am more than satisfied. I know
I can trust the patient in your hands, Miss Wallace.
You and your sister are a host in yourselves; so in
your care I leave her. My part of the work being
done for the present I will now go. Should there be
an undesirable change, let me know;” and with a few
more general instructions he bowed himself out.
Edith would have followed but he prevented her
from doing so.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“No; I can find the way myself while your place
is here—and—good evening, ladies,”—and he was
gone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Until now Hilda had not spoken a word. Her
whole attention was directed to the care of the sick
girl, every few moments lifting the cloths from her
head and replacing them with others taken from a
vessel of ice standing by the bedside. All this time
the sufferer never spoke, never moved. Imelda could
not see her face as it was turned partly away, and
partly concealed in a deep shadow. Edith now spoke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hilda, do you see this lady?” whereupon the
girl’s head quickly turned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, I did not know that there was anyone here,”
she said in tones of liquid music. Hastily turning to
Imelda, “I beg your pardon”—then to Edith.
“Whom did you say? I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Which is quite natural,” answered Edith smiling,
“as I have not said who; and as I know you will
never guess I may as well tell you. It is Imelda
Ellwood; the young lady Brother Wilbur has so
often told us about.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O! Imelda Ellwood!” exclaimed Hilda, with a
glad little cry, her face brightening with a sudden
joy. “I am so glad,” and impulsively extending
both hands she kissed her in greeting.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just then a smothered sound was heard from the
bed. With her well hand the wounded girl grasped
the cloth from her head and dashed it across the
room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who said Imelda? Where is she? I know of
but one Imelda, and she is far-away. Ha! ha!” laughing
wildly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder what Imelda would say? my beautiful
and good sister Imelda, if she could see me tonight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Would she soil her pure hands to wash mine?
I thought I heard someone speak her name. Say, do
you know her?”—and her glance travels unsteadily
from face to face. As her eyes rested upon the
white face of Imelda they settled there in a stony, set
manner. Her lips twitched convulsively as she slowly
raised herself upon her well arm. With a quick
movement Imelda now cast aside the hat that she
still wore. The next instant she had caught the
weakened but fever-flushed form in her arms.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cora!” She spoke the name calmly, and in a
tone of voice tender and gentle, as if the meeting and
finding of the wayward sister here was a matter of
course. Laying her cool hand upon the heated brow
and gently brushing the tangled hair therefrom.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cora, be calm and quiet or you will harm
yourself. Come, lie down and go to sleep.” From
the manner in which these words were spoken one
would scarce have thought that anything unusual
had happened. The influence of both words and
manner was instantly felt by the suffering girl.
Obediently she permitted herself to be laid back upon
the pillows. Her eyes closed. Her hand went
up to her head; then to her injured arm, thus indicating
where the pain was that tortured her. Hilda had
by this time replaced the cold cloths. Low moans
escaped the lips of the patient and soon two large
tear drops stole from beneath the closed eyelids.
Imelda gently brushed them away, now and then
murmuring a caressing word so low that only the
prostrate girl could hear. Her hand passed back
and forth across the fevered brow. The magnetic
touch seemed to do her good. Gradually the sufferer
became more quiet, and when the parched lips asked
for water it was Imelda’s hand that passed the cooling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>drink. In a little while the breathing became
more regular, and presently Cora was asleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>In all this time there had not been spoken one
word of explanation. Whatever of curiosity the
sisters may have felt none was expressed. Quietly
they waited until their guest should of her own accord
explain what seemed so strange. When Imelda
felt certain that her sister was fast asleep she gently
withdrew her hands and raising her eyes to those of
Edith she indicated that she wished to speak to her.
Not wishing to make the least sound in the sick room
the two went out together, leaving Hilda once more
to watch with loving care at the bedside.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as the door was closed upon their retreating
figures Imelda turned and looked Edith Wallace
full in the face. It was an ordeal she felt called upon
to pass through, and though a severe one she resolved
to meet it bravely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you understand what that girl is to me?”
pointing to the door of the room wherein the sick
girl lay.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have an inkling,” replied Edith, “but do not
quite understand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is my sister!” Like a wail the words
came from Imelda’s lips. She had managed to hide
her real feelings while in the atmosphere of the sick
room, but now she was in danger of losing control of
herself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Come with me,” said Edith, and she led the
way to a room at the other end of the hall.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here we will be undisturbed, and you can tell
me all you wish to impart. But I wish you to understand
that I expect you to say nothing that may
cause you pain to recall. The fact that this girl is
your sister makes her much less a stranger to me
than she would otherwise have been. Come, sit here
in this chair, here where you will be shaded from the
rays of the setting sun. Now, if you are comfortable
you may proceed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>What a cozy, homelike room it was. A bright
glowing red was the predominating color, softened
by the lace curtains and snowy draped bed. Here
and there was a dash of gold. The warm hues
seemed just suited to the glowing beauty of the girl
who sank into a seat opposite the chair wherein she
had placed Imelda, and here, in the cool half-dark
room, was told the sad story of how this wayward
sister had left the home of her childhood to go with
her lover.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of her own suspicion, however, that Cora had
never been a wife Imelda could not bring herself to
speak. How could she know how these sisters would
judge? She only told that from the hour that Cora
had left her home until now they had never seen her;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>never heard from her, “and now I am afraid,” added
Imelda, “she will be a burden upon your hands, an
imposition upon your kindness for an indefinite
length of time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hush! Not so, my friend,” interrupted Edith.
“I may call you friend, may I not? Would I not
have done as much for an utter stranger. Why then
not do it for one whom my brother holds most dear,
meaning yourself, of course; and I can not help accepting
your sister in the same light. But,” she
added smiling, “do you not think we have treated
your friend Mrs. Westcot, rather badly considering
it is over an hour since we left her alone to pass the
time away as best she could,—and now the shades of
night are beginning to fall.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda uttered a little frightened cry. “O, I
had forgotten! Poor Alice. I must go to her at
once. But first, if you will permit, I must see
Cora is still resting.” So, stopping for a moment to
inquire of Hilda as to the condition of the patient,
and being assured that she was still asleep and perfectly
quiet, the two found their way down the wide
stairway to where the little woman had been left to
entertain herself. Here they found that that tired
little morsel of humanity had fallen fast asleep in the
depths of the large arm chair wherein she had settled
herself, while the little girls seeing “Mamma” asleep
and having been taught at such a time to be very
quiet had climbed into a chair, which Meta had
pushed up to a window, and were watching the
stream of travel and traffic on the street.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the door opened little Meta turned her head
and seeing Imelda uttered a glad cry. It had been a
tiresome task to entertain the baby mind of Norma,
and the little heart beat joyfully at the prospect that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>the charge was over. The cry woke Alice who
started up a little confused, but immediately she remembered
where she was. Edith apologized for her
seeming neglect, but added:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sure you will excuse me when you fully
understand. I will go now and see to arranging our
simple evening meal, for of course you will take tea
with us. In the meantime your friend will make the
necessary explanation.” With these words, having
first lit several gas jets, and ere Alice could formulate
a protest she withdrew and left the two friends alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Imelda spoke not a word. Exhausted and
broken-hearted she sank into the nearest chair and
bowing her head upon her hands her overcharged
feelings gave way. Breaking into an uncontrollable
fit of weeping, sobs shook the slender figure while
tears trickled fast through her fingers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice was speechless. Surprise at this seemingly
uncalled for outburst of feeling, seemed for the
moment to rob her of the power of utterance. The
little ones stood with eyes wide open, wondering why
“Aunty Meldy should try!” as little Norma expressed
it. By and by Alice collected her wits sufficiently
to take the hands of the weeping girl and drawing
them from her face asked her what it all meant.
When Imelda had somewhat conquered her emotions
she said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Alice, you have been a true friend to me always.
You have made me your confidant in many things.
You know much of my earlier life, but not all. You
knew I had a sister and brother; you think they are
dead, as I simply told you that I had lost them, but
the inference is not true. Both have stepped out of
my life and have been as dead to me, for several
years. I have sometimes almost wished they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>indeed dead. Wild and wayward they had cast aside
the restraining influence of home and had gone—we
knew not whither. Never a sign of life did they give,
and my mother went to her grave calling vainly for
her absent ones.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Within the last few weeks, however, the knowledge
has come to me that both are alive. Several
weeks ago I encountered Frank in the grounds of
Maplelawn. Laboring under the misapprehension
of believing me to be mistress of the handsome mansion
he asked me for money. Finding I occupied
only a servant’s position he had no further use for
me, and disappeared as suddenly as he had appeared.
I know not what has again become of him; and”—with
a choking feeling in her throat—“upstairs with
a broken arm and a bleeding head lies my sister Cora!
Do you now understand?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda turned and going to the window gazed
blankly into the darkening night. She had spoken
hastily and in broken accents, as if ridding herself of
a very disagreeable duty. It was not pleasant to
speak of these family affairs. For her they meant
shame and disgrace, even though her whole being
recoiled from word or act impure. Her burning
brow was pressed against the cool glass and her hand
upon her aching heart. Many indeed had been the
trials she had been called upon to bear. Had it not
been that such rare and true friends had been hers to
smooth her rough pathway, and had it not been for
the love of a true man’s noble heart, she would often
have found life not worth the living. As she stood
there waiting she knew not for what, a hand stole
softly into hers and a gentle voice said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Imelda! I am sorry, so sorry for you, but—I
wish I had a sister! I have no one in all this wide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>world that has a claim upon me except my children.
There was a time when Lawrence was my heaven, but
now—you know and understand—that time belongs
to the past. You have a sister. Let us hope that
the finding of her will prove a blessing to you. The
same blood flows in your veins. It were strange indeed
if some of the same noble emotions did not also
move her heart.” Imelda was moved. She had
never heard Alice speak with so much depth of feeling.
She had not thought her friend possessed so
much real character.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you,” she said. “I hope so, indeed;
but do you understand? I will now be compelled to
remain here for some time to come. The doctor says
it will not be advisable to have her removed; so I am
in a manner bound to remain, which means that you
will for a time have to do without me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>By the sudden pallor of Alice’s cheek it was very
plain that she had not thought of that, but bravely
she put down all feelings of self.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, we will get along without you until
such time as your sister can with safety be removed;
then we will have her brought to Maplelawn where
you can nurse her until she shall have perfectly recovered.”
Imelda started.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no! That would be kindness too great to
accept. It would be too much; besides how would
Mr. Westcot accept the situation? It would be an
imposition; there is no gainsaying that. No! no!
Alice. I cannot accept your kind offer. As soon as
it is safe she will have to be removed to a hospital
where I shall make arrangements, if at all possible,
to have the care of her. If that cannot be done, why
then—I shall have to do the best I can for her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense, Imelda, do not speak like that.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Lawrence has never yet refused me an expressed wish
and I certainly do wish to have you near me as much
as possible. But there will be time enough to discuss
these matters later, for the present it is undoubtedly
understood that you remain here. The rest we will
trust to future developments. Just now,” she said,
in order to change the subject, “I wish you to help
me lay this sleeping child upon the tete-a-tete, as she
is becoming quite heavy;” and while Imelda was
arranging an easy position Edith returned.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice was more anxious to return home now, as
she would have to do so without her trusted and
faithful companion, but Edith insisted on refreshments
first, and while they were being partaken of
she sent out a servant to have Alice’s carriage brought
up to the house. But the carriage was already waiting
for them, and had been for some time. Osmond
Leland had been possessed of forethought enough to
attend to that matter. Edith explained to her guests
that when she and her sister were alone they dispensed
with the culinary art to a great extent, as
they were both fond of fruits, and in the summer it
was no difficult thing to have a variety of fruits on
hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maybe I am a little indolent,” she explained
smiling, “but I do not like to roast my brains above
a great fire, and by the same token I do not like to
see someone else do it either; so this is the result.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was no occasion, however, for Edith to
make excuses. The ladies found the simple meal
very refreshing. After it was over Imelda told Alice
what few articles she deemed it necessary that she
should send her; for as a matter of course she would
remain for the present, and take upon herself the
chief care of the wayward but now suffering sister.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>With the two sleepy little girls Alice was then snugly
tucked away in the carriage and the driver being
cautioned to be very careful, replied there was positively
no cause to fear. It was not likely that a
similar accident would again occur; had it not been
for the throwing of that unlucky stone the trustworthy
beasts would never have played such pranks.
With a wave of the hand Imelda saw the carriage
disappear, and with a heavy heart she again ascended
the stairs to relieve the patient Hilda, and to take
upon herself this new duty of nursing back to life
wayward, erring Cora. To life? and what else?
The sequel will show.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>In the days and nights that followed Imelda had
every opportunity for studying this sister pair, with
whom her manner of becoming acquainted was so
different from that she had pictured. The first week
was a trying time. Fever flushed the cheeks of the
injured girl, tossed her head upon her pillow, and in
her delirium she spoke of many things that caused
Imelda’s face alternately to pale and glow.</p>

<p class='c005'>If any reliance could be placed upon those wild
utterances, “storm tossed” would rightly apply to
the life she had been leading. In her troubled
dreams she was living in an atmosphere that was
strange to the much tried sister. At intervals she
would recognize Imelda for a few moments; then
there was a subdued light in the feverish eyes, a
nervous twitching about the lips. Her hand would
come creeping in a hesitating way, groping for that
of her sister. Imelda thought she understood.
Gently pressing the groping hand she would lay her
cheek to that of the suffering girl and whisper,</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is all right, Cora, never mind.” Sometimes
in lucid intervals, tears would force their way from
under the closed eyelids and roll down the faded
cheek. Imelda would gently wipe them away and
kiss the parched lips. But invariably the next moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>wild fancies would hold sway and she would
talk of things the patient sister could not understand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Edith and Hilda were of the greatest help to
Imelda. They would insist upon relieving her that
she might refresh her tired frame with hours of balmy
sleep, and also insisted that she should occasionally
take a walk in the evening or morning air. Hilda
more particularly proved herself a valuable assistant.
The soft magnetic touch of her hand seemed to give
ease to Cora in her most restless moments.</p>

<p class='c005'>For more than a week her life hung in the balance.
But her strong youth conquered, and after
the ninth day reason returned to its throne. The
gash upon the white forehead would be a disfigurement
for life. Happily the prevailing fashion of
hair dressing would almost completely hide the disfiguring
mark. The cruel wound was yet far from
being healed, but the danger was past. It now only
required time for her to gather strength. Already
she could sit daily for a few hours in a comfortable
arm chair and enjoy the sweet pure air at the open
window.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Wallace sisters had positively refused to
listen to any arrangement for removal of the patient.
“She will remain,” they had said, “until quite well.”
And here she still was, after two weeks had passed.
A marked change had come over her. Imelda saw
she was no longer the reckless, daring Cora of old.
A spirit of refinement rested on the white brow, and
shone in the no longer defiant eyes. There was a
story in the pained lines of the decidedly pretty face.
The loss of blood, the ravages of fever, and the pain
of the broken arm had robbed her of every vestige of
color. The ugly gash upon the white forehead had
now healed enough to remove the bandage, and only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>a narrow strip of court plaster was needed to cover
the still festering edges.</p>

<p class='c005'>As she was somewhat of the same build and size
as Hilda, that maiden had robed her in a pretty pink
tea gown with a white silk front, trimmed at the neck
and wrists with a soft fall of rich lace, a white silk
cord encircled the waist. The heavy light brown
hair had been combed school girl fashion, and hung
in two plain braids over either shoulder. With the
front hair Hilda had gone to some extra trouble to
have it look nice. It was a mass of fluffy, curling
ringlets, only at one end peeped the court plaster,
merely indicating what was hidden. With that look
of sadness, that was so new to the elder sister, and
which softened every line of her face, Cora was far
more than merely pretty.</p>

<p class='c005'>As yet the time that intervened since the sisters
had seen each other last had not been touched upon.
Both seemed to avoid it as if by mutual consent.
Today Cora lay back in her chair, her gaze fixed intently
upon the outside of the window, but it was
doubtful if she saw what was transpiring there.
Imelda had been reading, now she also was resting.
The book lay in her lap while she too permitted her
gaze to wander. After a time, however, she recalled
her wandering looks and directed them upon the face
opposite her, and in doing so she saw that two pearly
drops had stolen from beneath the half-closed eyelids
and were slowly trickling down the white cheeks.
Imelda noiselessly sank on her knees at her side, and
taking the well hand of the girl in both of hers, she
laid it against her cheek.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Cora?” she asked gently. “Can
you not trust your sister and tell her all?” But as
if the words had loosened the flood gates of her soul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>the tears gushed forth in torrents from the hazel
eyes; the white teeth sank deep into the quivering
lips, as if to quell the sobs that broke from them.
Drawing her hand away from Imelda she covered her
face while she sobbed as if her heart would break.
For a while Imelda did not speak, but permitted the
storm to spend its strength, knowing full well she
would feel all the better for it. When she had become
more calm Imelda passed her arm about her
waist and leaned her head against Cora’s arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Won’t you tell me?” she again pleaded. Again
the lips quivered and the tears flowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Melda, Melda, how can I? You in your
purity cannot understand. If I tell you all you will
withdraw your clean immaculate hands from me and—Well,
what matters it? I have chosen my path
and no doubt can continue to walk in it. When a
girl once steps aside from the straight way it is not
supposed that she should ever wish to return. That
circumstances rather than desire could send a woman
on the downward course to ruin is not considered at
all probable. I may have been wayward and wilful
in the past. I know I was not good and gentle and
dutiful as you were. But I was not possessed of the
same strong nature, and if I have done wrong, believe
me, Imelda, I have also suffered.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was bitter pain in the words that seemed
to dry the hot tears. Her mood was changing. She
was at this instant more like the Cora of old than she
had been since the accident. Imelda did not like it;
she feared it might lead her back to the old defiance,
but she hoped not. It should not, if womanly ingenuity
could prevent it. So she determined not to
notice the underlying bitterness. She pressed the
unhappy girl’s hand and said:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“Don’t be too sure of so easily ridding yourself
of your sister. I do not intend to lose you again.
Do you think it was for the mere pleasure of the
thing that I have been watching with you night and
day for the past two weeks? Oh, no! Since I have
found you I intend to keep you with me. An only
sister is not lightly lost sight of.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This last caused Cora quickly to turn her head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“An only sister? What about—little Nellie?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A sharp pang pierced Imelda’s heart. The
question showed her that Cora did not know of the
changes that had taken place. But as she hesitated
Cora seemed to understand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is little Nellie dead?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes!” softly answered Imelda’s voice, as her
arms tightened about Cora’s waist. “Little Nellie is
sleeping in our mother’s arms.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda felt the tremor in the weakened frame,
but no answer came from the pallid lips. But when
she looked up she observed the tears again stealing
from beneath the closed lids.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dead! dead!” she whispered, “and I was not
there. Maybe it was better so. If she had known
all that had taken place in my life it would only have
added another bitter drop to her already overflowing
cup. But you, Imelda! What are you doing here
so many miles from our western home? How came
you here?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you remember Alice Day, who used to
work at the store where we were both employed?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, you also remember that it is long since
she is no longer Alice Day but Mrs. Lawrence Westcot.
Lawrence Westcot’s home is in Harrisburg and
I have the care of her children, two sweet little girls.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“Here in Harrisburg?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, here. And just here, I may as well tell
you of another circumstance. On the day which
came so near being your last our old time friend with
her two little girls and myself were out driving in
her carriage when through the throwing of a stone
our horses took fright, and like mad they dashed
through the streets and—Well, do you understand
the rest? I was in the vehicle that caused you a
broken arm and an almost broken head.” Cora
smiled sadly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A pity it was not wholly broken,”—for which
she was reproved by Imelda.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t let me hear such words again. I will not
listen; but first tell me why you should use them and
then let me judge.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let you judge,”—fell in bitterest accents from
Cora’s lips. “Chaste, honest, truthful, will you be
able to judge me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope so, and as I hope that I am all that you
say, you must not forget to add ‘just.’ That is another
attribute to which I aspire. Now trust me,
little sister, and ease that aching heart. You will
feel better when it is all over; I am very sure.” So
at last Cora gathered up courage and began the confession
that in the last few days so often had hovered
upon her lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cora told how short the dream of happiness had
been that had enticed her to leave home and listen to
the tempter’s words. How the promised marriage had
been put off from day to day, and from week to week,
until the truth burst upon her that he never had had
any intention of making her a wife. A scene similar
to that recorded somewhere near the beginning of
this narrative was again enacted. Cora was no less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>emphatic in her demands than her mother had been
before her. But there was a difference: Herbert
Ellwood was a gentleman; one of nature’s noblemen.
But Tom Dixon did not know the meaning of the
word “honor,” and when he was tired of his plaything
he simply cast it aside. Neither threats, tears
or prayers could avail anything. Alone, a stranger
in a strange city she was helpless. He had taken her
as far as New York, and for a while the disgraced
girl was tempted to end her life in the quickest
way possible. Desperate indeed was her position;
without money; awaiting an event which, if nature
had justice done her, should be the crowning joy and
glory of a woman’s life, but which, instead, made her
a wretched outcast, a homeless, friendless wanderer.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her voice was husky and her cheek fever-flushed
as she proceeded with her story, not daring to meet
the eye of her sister.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had been considered pretty, I know, both of
face and form, and these drew the attention of a man
who had protected me from the brutal insults of some
roughs, and who, noticing my condition and circumstances,
and, attracted by something that even now I
cannot account for, took me under his immediate care
and protection. I soon discovered that he possessed
a tender heart, as well as a well filled purse. Placing
me in the hands of a skillful physician he procured a
nurse, and, when my baby was born, saw that I had
every attention.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At first I hated the little innocent because of
its father, but after it had lain in my arms and at my
breast the unnatural feeling gave way to one that
might have brought me some happiness if I had been
permitted to keep it. But just two weeks from the
day I first felt the touch of the baby lips the little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>unwelcome life went out, and I was left more
wretched than ever.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I did not love my new lover, (for such he was).
I don’t think I was then capable of love. My heart
was so full of bitterness. But Owen Hunter had
been kind to me when he who according to nature
ought to have protected me had cast me off. This
stranger had cared for the despairing outcast and
tided her over the stormiest waters. But there came
a day when he seemed to expect a return, a compensation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He came to call upon me one evening about
two months after my baby was born. As he often
came this fact was nothing new, and his coming always
brought with it a certain degree of pleasure, but
on this particular evening he drew me upon his knee,
fondled me, paid me pretty compliments and ended
by making me the blank proposal to become his mistress.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had been passive under his caresses, never
thinking what it all meant, but now it burst upon me
like a thunderbolt, and I saw only a repetition of past
experiences. I cast off his encircling arms and tottering
to my bed threw myself down and gave way
to an outburst of tears and sobs. For a while he let
me have my way; then came and sat beside me upon
the edge of the bed and talked to me for some hours.
He was enamored of my pretty face; called me
beautiful, and wanted me all to himself. He promised
me a life of ease; lots of money and pretty clothes.
He said he could not understand how a man could be
so heartless as to cast aside a girl so pretty. He
loved me well enough, he said, to have cared for my
little babe had it lived. He thought he had proven
to me that he was trustworthy, and if I was but willing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>to try him he was sure I would never rue it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As I said before, I did not love him, but I felt
a kindly feeling for the really handsome man, which
feeling I tried to persuade myself was love. I was
cast adrift without a friend or a dollar. What more
natural than that I should give heed to the sympathetic
voice? Then the thought came to me: If he
so loved me he might be willing to make me his wife.
So permitting him to take me in his arms and kiss
me I took his face between my hands and asked him,
would he not marry me? He laughed, as if it were
some good joke, but held me all the closer, and still
laughing shook his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Make you my wife, little girl? No! no! It is
not a wife that I want, but someone to love me; someone
to whom my coming will be sunshine; whose
laugh will be music to me; who will be sure to make
the evenings I am with her happy ones, and wives
don’t generally do that!’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I did not understand then what he meant
though I did so later. What I did understand was
that he refused to marry me. Whatever else the
offer contained it was not fair promises that he did
not mean to keep. Well, why should I continue? I
felt that here was a haven of rest, what else was open
to such as I? My past would always be a barrier to
my moving among so-called respectable women, and
I was desperate.</p>

<p class='c005'>“To make a long story short I accepted his offer.
But this man was truly kind to me. Through it all
he never once attempted to take a liberty I had not
first granted to him. He never forced his attentions
upon me. He soon seemed, however, to understand
better how matters stood. A change came over him.
Although many were the evenings that he spent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>with me he was not the same. I missed the joyous
happy laugh, and his impulsive caresses were toned
down to a light kiss, given at his coming and going.
He no longer remained very late. He brought me
books and flowers; he prevailed on me to take an interest
in many studies, offering to be my teacher. A
handsome piano found its way into my rooms on
which he taught me to play. Having made the discovery
that I possessed considerable talent in music
and also that my voice was above the common, he
did not rest until a competent vocal teacher was procured
for me. Evening after evening he was at my
side aiding me in my studies; leading me on and on
until I was surprised at the capabilities that had lain
dormant in my nature. I awoke to a hunger and
thirst for knowledge, and day by day I applied myself
more diligently to my studies. I was beginning
to be ambitious, the wellspring of which I did not as
yet understand, but I would see the smile of pleasure
and approval light up his face and I felt rewarded.
One evening when about a year had passed he paid
me this compliment:</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘My little girl is quite an accomplished lady
now.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can yet feel the flush of pleasure, the blood
mounting to my brow, as he laid his hand with caressing
touch upon my head, lightly brushing back my
hair. The action was new. Long ago he had laid
aside the lover and was merely the friend and teacher,
and it puzzled me to understand the meaning of it at
first. I had not heeded it much, but gradually my
feelings had undergone a change. He always treated
me with such perfect respect just as if I were some
high-bred lady. I learned to admire him first and
then a warmer feeling crept into my heart. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>evening came I counted the moments until he would
arrive. Sometimes it would be late, then a spirit of
unrest would make me miserable with the fear that
he might disappoint me, and when such would be the
case, as it sometimes happened, the spirit of unrest
and disappointment would not let me sleep. I awoke
to the knowledge that I loved him now if I had not
done so during those first weeks of our acquaintance,
and with this knowledge another feeling made itself
apparent. I felt that I was under obligation to him.
He was keeping me as a lady when I had no right
whatever to accept anything from him. One evening
I electrified him by telling him that I was going to
look for work. For a moment he looked at me as if
he thought I was not in my right mind, then he peremptorily
asked:</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘What is the meaning of this foolish notion?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘I have been a burden on your hands long
enough.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“He laughed,</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘A burden? Well! well! What put that idea
into this little dark head?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Is it then so strange that I should desire to
turn to practical advantage all the knowledge I have
gained through your kindness? I am sure it is time
I sought, in some measure, to repay you, and how
better can I do that than by doing something practical?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“A troubled look rested on his face as his eyes
searched mine.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Will you believe me, little one, that the evenings
spent here are the one pleasure in which I indulge?
the pleasure to watch your mind expand and
grow; the one pleasure which nothing else can replace?
And what of your studies? They are as yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>by no means complete. What is to become of them
while you work to earn a living?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“The sound of his voice changed. ‘I do not
want to hear such foolish words again. Until your
studies are mastered you are to think of nothing
else.’ That vibrating voice robbed me of all power
of resistance; and so no more was said on this subject,
but I felt my heart go out to him more and more.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But why did he never caress me now? Did he
no longer love me? Considering our relations in the
early part of our acquaintance it was strange; but I
felt a restraint that would never permit me to show
what I felt. The day he paid me the compliment of
being an accomplished lady I felt my heart leap with
joy. O how I longed to throw myself into his arms
and repay him in a warmer manner than I had ever
dared show him. But this indefinable something
stood between us and held me to my place. The next
evening, and every evening after that, I took extra
pains with my dress. I wanted to look nice when he
came, and with greater impatience than I had ever
known I awaited his coming. Often I succeeded in
drawing a word of praise from him which would send
the blood bounding through my veins.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One evening about a week after he had so
effectually overruled my intention to seek work I
arrayed myself in a soft gown of purest white, a color
which Owen most particularly admired. But on
that evening I waited in vain. The hours came and
went but they did not bring Owen. The next evening
the same experience was repeated and every evening
for a week, but the man who had become so dear
to me did not come; and the thought was slowly forcing
itself into my mind that he would never come.
If in the past there had been hours of despair the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>prospect of the coming time seemed so much darker
that truly life would not be worth the living if I was
again to be forsaken.</p>

<p class='c005'>“With weak and trembling hands I once more
arrayed myself for his coming. I wore a loose robe
of creamy silk fastened only with a white silken cord
at the waist. My last week’s experience had robbed
me of the roses that the few previous weeks had
called to my cheeks. It was Sunday evening and I
hardly dared hope that he would come that night.
It was the sweet Maytime and a great bunch of lilacs
filled their room with their fragrance. The evening
was warm. Doors and windows were open, and I
think I must have fallen asleep in my rocker for I
heard no sound, yet was aroused suddenly by the
feeling of a face close to mine. For a moment I was
frightened and involuntarily uttered a cry, but the
next moment seeing who it was, and forgetting everything
but that he, my friend, my lover, had returned,
I sprang to my feet and with the cry, ‘Owen! Owen!’
I cast myself upon his breast and twined my arms
about his neck. In that moment I knew that he had
not ceased to love, as I had feared, for holding me
close in his arms he pressed me to him and almost
smothered me with his kisses, whispering again and
again,</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘My little girl, my own little woman, you love
me now, my sweet? I have not waited in vain?’ I
answered him only with a happy laugh. My heart
was too full for anything else, but he understood,
for he again rained kisses upon my face calling me
by every endearing name that love had ever invented.
He never rightly explained why he had remained so
long away, but I understood then that circumstances
over which he had no control had caused it, and little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>did I care in my new-found happiness, for I was
happy,—happy as I had never thought I could be.
I sat upon his knee with my arms clasped about his
neck until away into the night. We had not struck
a light; he would not let me be free long enough to
do so. There was no need, he said, and I know that
not one softly whispered word of love was lost, and
with the most perfect ease his lips found mine. The
hour had come and gone that he was wont to leave
me, but as midnight approached he laid his lips to
my ear and whispered words that for a moment
caused my heart to stand still; and then to bound as
if to break its confines. The past year had made a
different woman of me and I now, as never before,
wanted the respect of the man whom I loved. He
felt my heart beating so madly and I know he guessed
the cause. He laid his face to mine and pleadingly,
tremblingly spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Darling, can you not trust me? my timid fluttering
birdie? I would not harm one shining hair
upon this precious head.’ And I did trust him, for
O Imelda, I loved him, I loved him. You, looking
down from your pure and lofty heights can not
understand it, but it was all so different from that
first experience that I had. I tried to realize the
enormity of my wrong-doing but I could not feel
impure when I was in his arms. My love for Owen
was something different from what I had hitherto
deemed love to be. I felt myself lifted above everything
sordid, everything unclean. Every feeling,
every thought connected with him was as something
holy, and now, as then, the thought will force itself
upon my mind: How is it possible that true, pure
love can ever be deemed impure! when its fires are so
purifying only holy emotions find room in the heart.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“But our love was without sanction of either
church or state and therefore the world would place
its seal, its stamp of ‘outcast’ upon the brow of such
as I. But is it not somewhere written that much
shall be forgiven to those who love much? And the
short time that followed I was madly, intensely
happy, while Owen seemed to be no less so. He
would catch me in his arms and lift me up as if I
were a baby while his blue eyes shone with a light as
of heaven.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘My own darling! my precious one!’ O, how
often did he say these words while I pressed his fair
head to my heart and thought heaven was in his
arms.” Cora broke off with a choking sob, while
the tears once more rolled down the pale cheek.
Imelda was still upon her knees at her side, was still
fondling the white hand when Cora again turned to
her:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why don’t you turn from me? I who have
been a mother, who have granted to man the greatest
boon of love a woman can bestow,—without first
being a wife! Why are you not angry with me? I
am sure I deserve it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, my poor, dear Cora! Why should I be
angry with you? For loving a noble man? I hope
I am not so narrow, and that I am able to judge you
more fairly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Cora’s hazel eyes expanded to their utmost extent.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Melda, what do you mean? I do not understand.
Do you not curse him and despise me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda shook her head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Neither,” she answered. “Although I do not
quite understand, yet according to your description
of the man I get the impression that he was noble and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>good. Nothing at all to warrant a judgment so cruel
from me. But now you must keep calm or I shall
not permit you to speak farther. I insist that you
lie down and rest, as this excitement may prove
injurious to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And if it should make an end of my miserable
life it might be the best thing that could happen to
me. I have been of but little good in the world,—only
to bring pain and sorrow into the lives of
others.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, now, Cora! Is it right you should talk
like this when you have but just finished telling of
the love of your Owen and the happiness you have
brought to him?” Cora put her hand to her head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You confuse me,” she said. “To hear you
speak like this causes me to doubt my senses. I do
not understand.” Imelda smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you will understand, by and by, when you
know all. Now I am waiting to hear the rest of
your story.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The rest of my story? Would that it ended
there; then, maybe, I might still have some faith
that my life is not all in vain. But to return and
finish. My dream was too bright and beautiful to
last. Such intense bliss is not for this world. I
ought to have told you before how I lived. Owen
had furnished a small house for me in princely style.
It was far up town and stood in a grove of trees and
isolated from the neighborhood. A most beautiful
garden was attached to it with richly scented flowerbeds
and vines and ivy-covered arbors. Certainly a
lovely spot and a perfect lovers’ home. From the
windows I could see the blue waters of the Hudson
and often I watched the stately steamers proudly sail
up and down its silver-hued bosom. As I stated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>once before, Owen had procured a nurse to attend
me in my hour of trial, a faithful colored woman,
and she had lived with me from that time on, keeping
my nest a bower of beauty. She always thought I
was Owen’s wife and he said nothing to dispel that
belief. She probably often thought it queer that
during all that year he had spent only a few hours in
the evening of each day with me, but she never said
anything.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One day when I was more happy, if that were
possible, than usual, a carriage drove up to my little
heaven. A footman opened the door and a richly
attired lady stepped therefrom and slowly came up
the shaded path. Old Betty met her at the door; I
heard them speak but could not understand what was
said. The old woman led the lady into our cosy little
parlor and then came to me in my own pretty bed
chamber upstairs. She brought me a card upon
which I read, ‘Mrs. O. Hunter.’ She was a woman
of perhaps twenty-eight or thirty years of age, very
tall, a decided brunette with flashing black eyes.
Her features were sharp, and a look indicating that
her tongue could be as sharp. I looked helplessly at
her and then at the card in my hand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Mrs. Hunter?’ I said, bowing—but her stiff
head never inclined. In a haughty, heartless manner
she spoke,</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘If you are able to read you ought to find that
correct. Mrs. Owen Hunter,’—with a decided stress
upon the ‘Owen.’ I was beginning to feel dazed.
‘Mrs. Owen Hunter’! My Owen’s name. Who
could she be?</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Well?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Well!’ she repeated. ‘Does not that speak
for itself? If not I will endeavour to be still more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>plain. I am tired of having my husband spend his
nights away from home. I warn you, girl! Owen
Hunter is my husband, and the father of my children.
If I still find, after this, that he continues
coming here, I shall find means to put an end to it,
and to make it go hard with you!’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was as if stunned! My head swam, as I
listened to this threat. My Owen the husband of
this woman! Impossible! Surely, surely, there is
some terrible mistake here. Not for one instant did
I permit myself to believe the cruel accusation that
had been hurled at me, but without deigning me
another look she turned in haughty scorn to leave
the room when her eye caught sight of a crayon
picture—Owen’s picture, my most especial pride,
which had been placed upon an easel. A look like a
thunder cloud passed over her face, and before I
could think what her intention might be she had
swooped upon it, knocked it down, and setting her
foot upon it crushed the glass into a thousand pieces,
cutting and hopelessly ruining the precious picture.
With a cry of dismay I stepped forward, but it was
too late, and with a mocking laugh she swept from
the room, leaving me in a heart-broken condition.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had not known that Owen had a wife, and as
yet I could scarcely believe it true. If such was the
case I knew full well it was to her he belonged and
not to me. How I managed to live through that day
I do not know. My heart felt like stone in my breast;
no tears came to ease or quench the aching, burning
pain.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the evening Owen came whistling up the
garden path, his handsome face all aglow with the
sunshine of happiness. He came bounding into the
room where I was sitting and the next instant he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>caught me in his arms and was madly straining me to
his breast, smothering me with kisses. But suddenly
he seemed to discover something amiss in my manner.
Holding me away from him the better to look
at me he said,</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘What is it, birdie? not sick are you?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Yes,’ I said, struggling with the tears,—‘heart-sick.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“All the sunshine, all the laughter was gone
from his face in an instant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Explain, sweetheart, what is it?’ For answer
I pointed to the ruined picture.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Why’——he stammered. ‘What has happened?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“To speak would have been impossible. I felt
as if a cold, unseen hand was clutching at my throat.
So I merely handed him the card with the name of
‘Mrs. Owen Hunter’ upon it. I shall never forget
the look of dismay that passed over his face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Do you mean to say she has been here?’ he
articulated. I merely inclined my head. His arms
fell slowly away from me and stepping to the open
window, he stood looking out into nothing for a long
time,—so long, indeed, that I thought he had forgotten
that I was there. When he turned back to me
his face looked in the gray twilight as if it had aged
ten years.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘And will my sweet love send me away because
of this woman?’ He asked the question holding my
hand in both of his, closely pressed to his cheek.
His voice did not sound the same. All the laughter,
all the life had left it. I saw he was suffering, and
the knowledge did not tend to lessen the pain that was
tugging at my own heart. I answered his question
with another.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“‘She is your wife?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘She is. But what of that?’—doggedly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Only that you belong to her, and not to me.’
Then he caught me in his arms and held me so fast
he almost crushed me.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘No! no!’ he huskily said, ‘it is false. I do
not belong to her. It is you that holds me, body and
soul. That woman never married me,—only my
money!’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘But your children?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘What children?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Why, yours—and hers.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘There are none!’</p>

<p class='c005'>“My head swam; she had said, ‘The father of
my children,’ and he said. ‘There are none.’ I looked
into the clear blue eyes and believed him. But in
spite of that I knew my dream of bliss was ended.
In his madness he made the proposition that we should
leave together,—go to some distant city, to Europe,
anywhere where we could remain together. The
world was wide and in some small corner we would
find room where we might be happy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But to this proposition I would not listen.
My mind was already made up. I would leave—leave
without saying a word about it. I could not
bear the thought of being the cause, perhaps, of his
ruin. If I told him I knew he would never consent;
but this one last night he was mine, and with that
shadow threatening to engulf us we loved with the
intensity of despair. But before the night had
waned, clasped closely in his arms he told me the story
which had wrecked his life.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c005'>With a weary movement Cora leaned her head
against the bolstered back of her chair. Imelda saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>that her sister was exhausted. Reproaching herself
for having permitted her patient to do so much talking
she gave the order, “Not one more word!”
and helping her to disrobe she gently assisted her
back to her couch. With a new tenderness she arranged
the pillows and then insisted upon perfect
quiet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tomorrow will be another day, and time
enough to proceed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Cora did not protest, and soon the weary eyes
were closed in slumber. Long did Imelda watch the
sleeping girl while she was conscious of a new feeling
toward this erstwhile wayward sister. Her heart
went out to her as it had never done before, and
henceforward she knew she would not be quite alone
in the world as she had been. She felt that she had
now found her sister, in more senses than one.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just here it might not be out of place to make
mention of that other pair of sisters to whom these
two were at the present time under such heavy obligations.
It had seemed rather queer to Imelda that
the two should be all alone in this large house, as she
had understood from what Wilbur had told her that
the sisters lived in the home of their father who with
the second wife had quite a family of children, but of
whom there was not a trace to be seen. Only a day
or two ago, however, Edith had explained to Imelda
how matters stood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>From this explanation it was evident that neither
of the two elder daughters had any too much love for
the stepmother, who was domineering in character.
Of late years the freedom-loving Edith had refused
to submit to her many dictations. She absolutely
refused in any manner to be a subordinate. When
Hilda found her sister making such a brave effort to
free herself from the domination of the stepmother
she was not long in following her example. The
stepmother appealed to the father, who in turn
ordered his daughters to explain.</p>

<p class='c005'>Edith did explain. She said that Hilda and herself
were now old enough to judge for themselves in
all personal matters. They demanded freedom in all
their actions. If it were refused them at home they
would seek a home elsewhere. With youth and
health they were confident they would not starve.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Edmund Wallace was a proud man. After
the disastrous ending of his first marriage, with the
second wife, brilliant and fashionable, at his side,—a
woman who seemed better to understand how to manage
her husband than did the timid Erna before her,
Mr. Wallace had been more successful financially.
Dabbling in politics he had secured to himself political
and social position and hence the idea that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>daughters should leave his house to find a home elsewhere
was not at all to his liking. Such a thing
would draw attention, and cause unpleasant notoriety.
So, for once, he sided with his daughters and gave
his wife to understand that they were at liberty in all
personal matters to do as they pleased.</p>

<p class='c005'>The haughty woman was almost strangled in her
anger, but found herself forced to submit. But if
she could no longer domineer there were a thousand
other ways in which she could make the lives of the
girls a daily torture. The result was that Edith again
turned to her father, telling him that under existing
circumstances they could not and would not longer
remain. So another and more decided change was
made. A room was assigned to Edith and Hilda as
their “sanctum.” Through the political influence
of the father positions were secured for both girls,
which furnished them with pocket money to spend as
they saw fit. The salary of each was sixty dollars
per month, twenty of which each contributed toward
keeping up the establishment. This arrangement
made them independent, and from the day it was
made both refused to take part in the household
duties. Mrs. Wallace had to procure hired help.
Then it was she came to realize the full value of these
despised stepdaughters. But as she considered it
beneath her dignity to unbend towards the girls there
was a constant frigidity between them.</p>

<p class='c005'>There were four children from this second marriage,
two girls and two boys; the girls being the
eldest. All four were away at school. Mr. and Mrs.
Wallace were away spending the hot summer months
at some mountain resort. The girls having vacation,
nothing averse, took charge of the house, expecting
later in the season to spend a week or two on some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>quiet country farm. To the circumstance of the
absence of the rest of the family was it due that Cora
had found such a haven of rest under this roof prepared
by the kind and loving hearts and hands of this
sister pair. That she herself was the sister of one
who had such a warm friend in that absent brother
who to them personated the whole of manly graces
and perfections, made it to seem more like a privilege
than otherwise that they should have been permitted
to lavish their tenderest care upon her; besides the
sufferer had won for herself a place in these sisterly
hearts that was all her own, a place that no one would
be able ever to deprive her of.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice had often called during the past two weeks
but as yet had not seen the injured girl. Somehow
Cora had always been asleep and it was deemed unwise
to awaken her. Norman also had found his way
several times to the Wallace abode, as indeed it would
have been strange if he had not. When making his
first visit he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“It seems we are destined to love under difficulties—always
someone claiming the love and attention
of the woman that I would fain monopolize.” When
he heard that in this case the claim came from the
lost and erring sister a cloud had for a moment rested
upon his manly face. Then gravely and tenderly he
had said, kissing the pure forehead of the girl he
loved,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do what you think is your duty, and what you
think is best, my sweetheart. I would not have you
do otherwise,”—and then Imelda had gone back to
her sister’s bedside with a much lighter heart and
with a new sense of happiness. Today, as she stood
watching the face of the sleeping sister, thoughts and
feelings came crowding upon her that she herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>might have found difficult to analyze. Poor Cora,
thought Imelda, how manifold and how oft painful
had been her experiences. If she had dealt many a
cruel blow to others, in the thoughtlessness of youth,
it was very evident that she had suffered much and
keenly, and yet—looking at her experiences without
prejudice, was she not, in some respects, more to be
envied than to be pitied or condemned? This very
reckless daring that was Cora’s chief characteristic,
had secured to her a term of such intense, such exquisite
happiness that Imelda, with her high strung
morals, could never hope to attain, and as she bent to
kiss the sleeping girl she whispered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You possess more courage than the sister you
think so pure. You are more true to nature and to
yourself than I.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When Cora awoke, refreshed from a long sleep,
she would have resumed the recital of her story but
Imelda positively refused to listen. Instead the invalid
was again arrayed in the pretty wrapper and,
with the assistance of Hilda, was led down the broad
stairway to the handsome parlor. Here the trio of
girls read, played and sang for her amusement, and
several times during the evening Cora’s clear, sweet
laugh rang out, making music in Imelda’s heart. An
unbroken night’s rest followed, and the next morning
found the sisters once more seated by the window
and Cora ready to take up the thread of her narrative
where she had left off the day before.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Owen Hunter was the only child of very wealthy
parents. They were the possessors of millions.
All the advantages that wealth can procure had been
his. At college he had graduated with the first
honors. He was gifted with talents of high order—a
poet born; a musical genius, and his gift of song
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>alone would have made him famous, had he so
desired. But, as is so often the case with natures of
this kind, he was very impulsive. The blood in his
veins was extra hot, and at the early age of eighteen
he had got himself entangled with a dark-eyed southern
beauty, whom he deemed the perfection of all
womankind. His mother had died when he was sixteen,
else she might perhaps have been able to guide
him with loving gentleness where reason and parental
commands failed. The girl with whom he had fallen
so madly in love was also wealthy, and had had the
benefit of a thorough education—that is, a fashionable
one. She knew how to dance, how to bow
gracefully. She possessed an exhaustless supply of
small talk, quick of repartee, brilliant and witty.
She knew how to haughtily snub a social inferior—and
so on through the long list of fashionable accomplishments.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Owen saw only the fascinating smile and the
wild, witching beauty that had set fire to his brain.
For some reason his father was opposed to an alliance
with Leonie Street. Perhaps he better read beneath
the attractive surface. But Owen was determined,
and when he was scarcely twenty he married the girl
who had so completely bewildered his senses. Young
as he was he was at the head of a large business firm.
His father of late had been in poor health, and upon
the young man’s shoulders was laid the burden that
had become too heavy for those of the older man.
And when his father died, stepping into his inheritance
he found himself worth some twenty millions
of dollars.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Long ere this, however, Owen Hunter discovered
that he had made a grand matrimonial mistake.
The woman he had married was only a fashion plate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>with this difference. A fashion plate is called inanimate,
whereas Mrs. Hunter was possessed of a temper
so fiery that she became quite dangerous when something
occurred to arouse her ire. In her passionate
moods she was so vulgar as to be disgusting. One
babe had come, but as if her passion was a poison
that killed, the little thing lived only a few days, and
none other ever came.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of short duration had been their honeymoon.
She managed soon to thoroughly disenchant her boy
husband—to cure him of the infatuation that had led
him to brave even his father’s displeasure; displeasure
which might have meant a great deal to him, as his
father was noted for a certain bull-dog tenacity or
stubbornness. When once he took a stand, either
for or against, he would hold to it, to the bitter end,
no matter if later he found that only he was in the
wrong and all others in the right.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Since there was no sweet baby smile to woo and
win the hearts of these two, Owen and Leonie Hunter
daily drifted farther and farther apart, neither
caring, or little caring, what the other was doing.
His millions were at her command wherewith to
satisfy her every whim, and this wealth enabled her
to worship at the shrine of fashion, to her heart’s
content. Their ‘home’ was a mansion; one of the
most beautiful of homes but Owen Hunter only went
to it to sleep, and not always then. Sometimes home
did not see him for weeks at a time. The clubs
suited him better than the princely mansion which
contained his dark-browed wife. His wedded experience
had made him reckless, and he made the most of
what his wealth would buy him. He was not by
nature bad; not by any means. He was only what
circumstances had made him. Deep down hidden in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>the innermost recesses of his being were the germs of
a noble manhood, but those germs were fast going to
decay for want of the magic touch which would waken
them to life and growth. Sometimes he felt heart-sick
and soul-weary when he realized that with all
the wealth at his command there was none so poor as
he; that his bosom bore a starving heart. In all the
vast multitudes of the great city there was not one
face to brighten at his coming, to smile a welcome at
his return to the place he called home.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In a mood like this, one evening as he was
passing a deserted thoroughfare he was attracted by
a woman’s cry. A woman was struggling in the
grasp of a man. A well directed blow felled the
ruffian to the earth while the rescuer caught an almost
fainting girl in his arms.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That was the way in which I became acquainted
with Owen Hunter. He offered to see me to my
home. I told him I had none. He seemed to understand
it all in a moment, and afterwards he told me
that he did so understand. A young woman whose
condition was so apparent, and no home, could have
only one story to tell,—a very common story, and at
that moment he felt, as he afterwards explained, just
as forlorn and alone, just as hopeless and homeless.
It was as if I had touched a hidden wellspring. He
drew my arm through his and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Come.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was trembling in every nerve. The terror I
had undergone almost paralyzed me. He saw I was
almost unable to stand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Will you trust me?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“One look into the clear eyes told me that it
would be safe, and I only nodded my head. I could
not trust myself to speak. I hardly knew how it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>happened, but in a few moments more I found myself
seated in a closed carriage, and that night I slept
safely housed, with a little confidence in mankind
restored.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know the rest. I told you the story yesterday;
of how he came to love me and I him, until
our love glorified our lives. Never until the darkly
passionate woman stood before me did I know that
another had a stronger claim upon him than I. He
did not know through what chance she had become
possessed of his secret. He felt sure she cared little,
only it gave her a chance to empty the poison vials of
her temper and spleen in a manner that she was conscious
would strike me in a vital spot.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘She thinks to part us, loved one,’ he said,
‘but she shall not succeed. I will not sacrifice the
only bright spot that makes my life worth living.
You, my darling, have redeemed me. You have
taught me the bliss of the love of a true woman.
You have made a new being of me, and to you I belong;
while you are mine by the might and power of
that holy love that you bear me.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, Imelda, forbear to judge me from the high
pinnacle of morality and purity upon which I know
you stand. Although I had made up my mind to
disappear out of his life—that he should not know
what had become of me,—but this one last night I
wanted to be happy, happy in the present hour and in
the feeling that he was mine and I his. I would not
think of the morrow and what it would bring. I
only gave myself up to the hour and to my love, and
when the bright sun of another day had risen he still
held me so closely in his arms that it seemed he meant
never to release me.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Have patience, my own one,’ he said, ‘if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>should not see me for some time. I will have much
to arrange, but when all shall have been attended to
I will fly to you, never again to leave you; for I cannot,
I will not give you up.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought my heart would break, as he held
me in his arms, whispering to me his plans of hope
and happiness. But I forced back the scalding tears
and with smiling lips kissed him goodby. I stood at
the doorway and watched him out of sight.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Out of sight!’ Could it have been out of
mind as well, it would then not have been so hard to
bear. I re-entered my room, threw myself upon my
bed and wept myself to sleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Long hours I lay thus. When at last I awoke
the sun was high in the heavens; my limbs were
weary and my heart heavy, but I knew I had work to
do, the hardest part of which was to write Owen a
letter wherein I should bid him farewell, as I thought
it better to part than that I should be the cause of his
ruin. I had some money, money he had given me,
and many valuable jewels and trinkets. To me they
were possessed of a double value as they were the
gifts of his love. I packed a trunk with such things
as it seemed necessary that I should take with me;
selecting the plainest of my dresses. Then having
sent old Aunt Betty on an errand, I managed to procure
a wagon to take my few belongings to the ferry
and thence to the depot and—I have never seen him
since.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is only two short months ago, but to me it
seems ages. Not caring whither I was going, as all
the world was alike to me, I procured a ticket with
scarce an idea where it would take me. My trunk
checked, I patiently waited for my train. For two
hours I never stirred, gazing fixedly at my tightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>clasped hands. Had not the strangeness of my demeanor
attracted the attention of an old gentleman
who kindly asked me where I was going, I might
have missed my train. He doubtless saw something
in my face that was not quite satisfactory for he asked
to see my ticket and found that my train would be
due in a few minutes. Taking me under his immediate
care he saw that I was made comfortable, as, fortunately,
he was to take the same train, and was
bound for the same destination.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How I reached Harrisburg I suppose I shall
never know, for one day I awoke to find myself in a
hospital bed, my face wan and thin and too weak to
lift my head. I was told that I had been brought
there four weeks before, delirious with fever, and
that I constantly required the care of several nurses.
But youth was in my favor and I soon regained health
and strength, and in two weeks more I was discharged.
It was the old gentleman who had befriended
me on the train who had also caused me to
be taken where I would be cared for during my illness,
and through his kindness it was that I found
my belongings when able again to care for myself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It had been just two weeks since my release
from the hospital when the accident occurred that
brought me here. If my thoughts had been with me
I don’t think it could have happened. But Owen’s
image still lives in my heart. It is not so easy to
obliterate it therefrom, right or wrong. I still love
him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Here Cora’s overwrought feelings again gave
way, and she sobbed as if her heart would break.
Imelda gently placed her arm about the weeping
girl’s neck and pressed her against her own bosom.
Tenderly she brushed her hair and kissed the tear-wet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>eyelashes. With a quick unexpected motion Cora
caught the hand that was caressing her cheek and
pressed it to her heaving breast.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can you still find room for me in your pure
and stainless heart? Can you still love me? But oh,
you can’t understand how hard it was to give him
up. Indeed! indeed! I have tried so hard to overcome
this love, but it is stronger than I. It overcomes
me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda bent and kissed the quivering lips.
“Poor little sister! Have I been so cold and merciless
in the past as to cause you to believe that I am
so small and narrow as to heap censure upon this
bowed head? to still farther lacerate your bleeding,
aching heart? No, no! you poor child. If in the
past you have been childishly wayward I may not always
have rightly understood you. If you have
dared to fly in the face of society, of man-made laws,
it is you who have been the sufferer, and when the
sweetest boon that comes to woman’s life was held
out to you and you were brave enough to grasp it
and to bask in its glorious sunshine, I certainly cannot
condemn you. I had not dreamed that the material
of so grand a woman lay hidden beneath the
surface of that saucy, independent child. A grand
and glorious woman indeed is my sister Cora, and I
am proud of her!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Cora’s great hazel eyes were opened wide with
astonishment. As if by magic the tears ceased to
flow; her face grew deathly white; huskily she
whispered,</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it you mean, Imelda? I do not understand.
I have heard your words but have not caught
their import. The Imelda that I know regarded a
life such as I have been leading a deadly, hideous sin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>and your words almost imply that——I——have done
right.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They do imply it, darling! I think you have
been brave and true and strong. It might be,
though, that it was because you were not so strongly
bound, as I, by the fetters of prejudice, but I also am
getting rid of these fetters and hope soon to be a free
woman, and in the measure that I am gaining liberty
I understand better what it means to others to be
deprived of that precious boon. Sister mine, my
eyes have been opened to many evils existing in this
world, and the starvation of woman’s sex-nature until
marriage, when the starvation generally changes
to surfeit and sex slavery is one of the greatest evils
that this world knows. A few men are intelligent
and noble enough to understand this; men who suffer
almost as much from this accursed system as do most
women, and, little girl, your Owen was one of these
noble men. After all you have told me about yourself
and him I am rather surprised you did not dare
the world and claim your own.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Imelda! This from—you! I wanted to save
him from himself. I know he would never have
given me cause to rue it had I entrusted myself, my
life, to his care. He was too noble, too true for that.
But you know the law gives him to that other woman,
and how it would have hurt him in the society
wherein he moves and in which he ranks so high.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I understand. Love blinded you to your own
interests while you sought to guard only his, forgetful
of the fact that every pang that was torturing
your own heart would find an echo in his. Oh, what
a horrible structure is society; built as it is upon the
quivering hearts of poor bleeding humanity!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Cora listened in open-eyed wonder to the words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>that fell from the lips of her sister. To her unsophisticated
ears they sounded like rank treason, only
that she knew that Imelda’s mind and heart were not
capable of treason. Long and earnestly therefore
did the elder sister talk to the younger one, trying to
make clear her views and theories, and as Cora
caught their import a new hope, like sweet balm,
crept into the weary heart. Was she then not the
loathsome and vile thing the world would have her
believe herself to be? Could it really be that true
love, soul-elevating, ennobling and purifying love,
does not need the sanction of state and church to give
it those redeeming qualities? O, how like another
being she would feel if the sweet consciousness could
be hers that she was not unclean and defiled; but that
her love was just as pure and holy as in its highest,
noblest sense it ever could be.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Long ere this the assurance had been Imelda’s
that Edith and Hilda were both true sisters of their
brother Wilbur, and that they espoused sex reform
in its highest sense, and when an hour later these two
bright girls joined the Ellwood sisters Cora was again
surprised to hear the same sentiments voiced in equally
strong language. Hilda knelt beside the dumb-founded
Cora, and while playfully fondling her hand
told her of plans that had been maturing in that
youthful head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sometimes,” she said, “when we shall have
more money at our command than now, we will build
ourselves a home. O, such a glorious, beautiful
home, in some retired or isolated spot, and our lovers
shall come and share it. But only just so long as
they are our lovers, for we want no masters. We
shall be strong enough, and capable of standing at the
head of our home ourselves, and directing its management.
Don’t you think so? Our home shall be
our kingdom, and we shall reign queens therein, and
our lovers will be our dear friends and comrades,
instead of husbands. Will not that be glorious?”</p>

<p class='c005'>With an experience such as hers had been it was
not much to be wondered at that Cora became an apt
pupil of this, to her, new doctrine, and of which this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>trio of girls were such enthusiastic advocates. Edith
and Imelda smiled as they listened to the glowing
description of Hilda’s home while a new and wonderful
light began to glow in the hazel eyes of the bewildered
Cora, and then she began to question, and
all the time one utterance of Hilda’s kept ringing in
her ears: “When we shall have more money.”
When? But first she wanted to know and understand,
and for a while she kept the trio busy answering
her questions. She had become deeply interested
and now wanted fully to understand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How many are there in this scheme? How
many such daring members are there?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” answered Hilda, “there are four of us
here; for of course you are in it. Then that wonderful
brother of ours is the lover of a sweet girl in that
western home of yours. Margaret Leland is her name.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Margaret Leland!” interrupted Cora, and
looked inquiringly at Imelda. “Was there not—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The same,” said Imelda. “She was employed
at the same store where we used to work, and for
years has been my best friend. It is to her largely
that I am indebted for my present views. But now
please let Hilda proceed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” continued Hilda, “Margaret’s mother
comes next. From all accounts we could not well get
along without her and—well, I don’t know. Is there
anyone else?”—looking inquiringly at the girls.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think,” answered Imelda, “It will be perfectly
safe to count Mrs. Westcot in—‘Alice Day,’
Cora, I was speaking of her before. That makes
seven, I believe, and who knows, by the time ‘our
home’ is built there may be as many more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And how many lovers are there?” asked Cora.
This caused a little laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>“One I know, and two I believe,” was Imelda’s
answer to Cora’s question. “Wilbur Wallace, the
brother of these dear girls, we can be sure of, and
Norman Carlton I hope may soon be able to see clear
enough to be willing that woman should in all things
decide for herself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who is Norman Carlton?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A beautiful rosy color swept over Imelda’s sweet
face, and Cora was answered. “O,” she said with a
slight gasping sound, “now I know how you understood
so well.” Then Hilda spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been waiting for Edith to make some
kind of announcement, but she sings ‘mum.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hilda!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Edith! I am not afraid, sister mine. You
know you met a very interesting gentleman last year
in our rambles on the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes! but child, you also know that we have not
seen him since, and as we had just received a call to
come home immediately we left without a word of
farewell;—then again we did not get a deep enough
insight into the views of Paul Arthur to enable us to
ascertain whether or not he is a free lover.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, but I heard him express himself very
clearly at one time on the subject of marriage. ‘It
is the grave of love,’ he said, ‘the altar upon which
the holiest emotions are sacrificed.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It may all be true,” Edith replied, “but as I
remarked before, we may never see or hear from him
again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,” Hilda said, kissing Cora’s pale cheek,
“have you no contribution to make in the shape of a
lover?” slowly the rich color swept over the pale
face; involuntarily her eye sought Imelda’s. Was
there a meaning in the glance? She smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“Can you see the rising sun?” Imelda asked,
but for answer the pearly drops filled the sad eyes.
“O, if I dared hope.” To the inquiring looks of the
sisters Imelda replied:</p>

<p class='c005'>“When Cora is stronger I am sure she will tell
you her story in all its details, as you have proved
yourself so trustworthy. A cloud at present overcasts
the heaven of her love; but don’t clouds always
in the course of nature move on, and are not the
heavens always so much clearer and more beautiful
after their removal? So hope, little sister. I expect
ere long to look into the sunny laughing eyes of
your Owen. The world is large but not so large but
that the divine magnet of love will attract and direct
each one to his or her affinity.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus bringing hope and cheer to the weary aching
heart of the girl, the days, one by one passed by.</p>

<p class='c005'>Several weeks more had now passed away. Cora
had gained rapidly in strength, and as Mr. and Mrs.
Wallace were now daily expected to return home and
the girls wishing to avoid an explanation it was
thought best to remove the patient to the abode of
the Westcots. Alice was also anxious to have Imelda
return as she was fast losing all control of her little
daughters. Tender, loving mother that she was she
was totally unfit to train her little ones. Besides she
was not yet really strong.</p>

<p class='c005'>With an unwilling heart Cora had bade good bye
to the sisters who had shown her so much kindness
and love.  Imelda’s eyes, too, had filled with tears as
she kissed both gentle girls, but she carried with her
the promise that she should soon see both at “Maple
Lawn.” Cora’s cheeks were tinged with a faint
peach-bloom color denoting the return of health, and
her eyes sparkled as she and Imelda were swiftly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>driven along towards the outskirts of the city where
the Westcot mansion was situated amid its beautiful
gardens. Just as the setting sun was casting the last
golden rays across their path the carriage drove up
the beautiful maple-drive to where little Alice, in
daintiest of white gowns, was awaiting them, her eyes
sparkling with joy at the prospect of having Imelda
once more with her. The little girls also, arrayed
in their pretty white dresses, were watching for their
“Miss Meldy.” They clapped their little hands and
fairly danced with delight when the figure of their
young teacher alighted. They grew somewhat
quieter when a second lady, so pale and languid,
stepped from the carriage and slowly followed the
more quickly moving Imelda. She caught the little
ones in her arms and they clung to her as if they
would never again let go of their beloved friend.
Alice, finding herself overlooked in this meeting,
turned to Cora. Holding out both hands in welcome
she made the sad-eyed girl feel that her words were
no formal phrase, but that they came from a warm
impulsive heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope not to be a burden long,” said Cora. “I
am beginning to feel quite strong now, and in a short
time hope to be able to look about for some work to
do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice laid her hand upon her lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not one word more. A burden indeed! On
the contrary I feel as though I had a great deal to
make good. This, (touching with her dainty finger
the red mark which was just peeping from beneath
the mass of ringlets that covered the young girl’s
forehead) this will be a constant reminder of what
might have proved a fatal accident, and as yet I have
had no opportunity to right the wrong that has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>done.” Cora protested but Alice had her way, as
that little woman invariably did have. She herself
conducted her up the wide staircase to the room which
had been set apart for her and which adjoined
Imelda’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought you two might want to be near each
other,” she explained. “Better now let me help you
dress for dinner. I will be your dressing maid.
How long do you expect still to nurse your arm? It
must be tiresome to have it so tightly bandaged.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Cora smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O yes,” she said. “It will be quite pleasant
when I shall be able to move about with more freedom
again. I will not then feel so much as if I were a
constant task on some one’s hands, so almost perfectly
useless.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please don’t!” in a pleading manner the little
woman spoke the words. “Can I not make you
understand that you are not a task and burden? Had
it not been for that almost fatal drive those long
weary weeks of pain would have been spared you—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And in all probability I should have missed
meeting the best of friends,—would have failed to
find my one, my only sister. No! no! the little pain
that I have endured does not so much matter, and if
you can all have patience with me until my strength
returns and I am once more myself I am sure I have
every reason not to complain, for the good the last
few weeks have brought me far outweighs everything
they may have contained of unpleasantness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus chattering in a friendly way Alice was
endeavoring to array Cora in a pretty gown of soft,
clinging, warm-hued material, but the fussy little
woman was far too excited to be of any real use, and
not until Imelda appeared, already dressed, was her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>toilet completed. With deft and ready fingers
Imelda lent the needed assistance, then selecting some
of the bright-hued flowers from a vase filled with the
various blooms of mid-summer, and which was standing
upon a small table near one of the open windows,
she twined them in the dark chestnut coils, then fastening
a bunch at the snowy throat and standing at a
distance she measured her sister with a critical and
admiring look.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now look at yourself. Do you think you
would please a fastidious eye?” The vision that met
her gaze as she turned to the mirror was a mixture
of girlish sweetness and of serious womanly dignity.
Returning health and strength were filling the fair
form with a roundness and tingeing the serious, half-sad
face with exquisite color. Cora gave more
than a passing glance at the reflected full-length
image, and while she looked the eyes of both fair
women in attendance were watching her face, and
presently they saw the lips quiver, the eyelids droop
and the crystal drops force their way from under
them and cling like liquid pearls to the dark lashes.
Imelda’s face bent over her sister’s till it rested on
the dark-crowned head. Instinctively she felt what
the thoughts were that caused the tears to gather, but
she had not one word to say. Cora’s well hand went
up to Imelda’s face and her lips whispered,</p>

<p class='c005'>“He whom my appearance would please is not
here; so what does it matter?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda shook her head and forced a smile to her
lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, but, little sister, it does matter. Don’t
you know that you are to meet someone else tonight
that I wish so much to be pleased!” Playfully smiling
she lifted the drooping face and looked into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>tear-wet eyes. The questioning look in them suddenly
gave way to one of understanding.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had forgotten that I was of some importance
tonight. Yes, you are right. It does matter, and I
do want to please.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dinner was now announced and the trio descended
to the dining room. Here Lawrence Westcot was
awaiting them. Imelda had not seen him since the
unpleasant meeting with Frank in the garden, and
unexpectedly finding herself opposite the dark-eyed
passionate man threatened momentarily to disconcert
her. A flush mounted to her brow, then receded,
leaving it marble white. But quickly regaining her
self-possession she saw that no one had noticed anything
amiss. Mr. Westcot came forward and in a
few well chosen words expressed his pleasure at her
return: next he acknowledged the introduction to
Cora, for a moment closely studying her face. The
dinner came off rather quietly to say nothing of the
feeling of restraint felt by all. Alice seemed to have
lost the fear that for so long had been a drawback to
her full recovery, at least it was not now so apparent,
but there was no confidence as yet established between
herself and Mr. Westcot. They were more
like strangers who found the task of getting acquainted
a tedious and irksome one. Imelda, with
the consciousness that the memories of the past
brought her, felt great constraint, and it is not to be
wondered at that Cora felt the influence thus brought
to bear upon her, and felt quite uncomfortable. The
ladies spoke in monosyllables, and although the
efforts of Lawrence Westcot to produce something
like a flow of conversation, to bring a feeling of harmony
to the little company, were almost incessant
they fell decidedly flat. So when the meal was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>brought to a close the feelings that were retained were
anything but pleasant. Lawrence made his excuses
almost instantly and withdrew, thus clearing the field
and leaving the ladies to themselves. They were not
slow in taking advantage of the fact that they were
alone, and as the husband paced the veranda the
voices of the chatting and laughing women came very
clearly to his hearing. A bitter smile curved his lips.
He felt that he was no longer welcome in his own home.
Yet was any one to blame but himself? But what
had he done, he asked himself, other than men were
wont to do? Nothing! he felt sure. But an inward
voice whispered,</p>

<p class='c005'>“These women are not like other women. You
have not understood them, but have taken it for
granted that they were the same. When too late
you recognized the fact, and all your efforts to set
yourself right in your own home have been vain.
Yet have these efforts been all they should have been?
Have you in reality done all that could be done?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He leaned against a pillar and gazed into the
darkening shadows of the coming night while thought
chased thought. Yes! he would make one more
effort, for was not the life he was leading in his
palatial home fast becoming unbearable? While he
was dreaming with open eyes a queenly head appeared
before him, crowned with a glorious wealth
of dark hair. Passionately dark eyes emitted flashes
of fire, scornful in their scintillations.</p>

<p class='c005'>Passing his hand over his eyes with an impatient
movement he heaved a weary sigh and in a tone that
was almost a moan the words broke from his lips,
“Why, O why is this all!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Just then a step aroused him, and glancing up
the friend of other days stood before him. Very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>seldom indeed had Norman Carlton favored Maplelawn
with his presence in these later days. The
harmony that had once existed there was broken,
though he did not understand why, and in consequence
remained away. Westcot had long ago recognized
the injustice of the unmanly words he had in a
fit of passion hurled at his wife, and if he had needed
proof that he was wrong, Carlton’s remaining away
during the enforced absence of Imelda Ellwood and
his sudden reappearance at the very moment of her
return, ought to give him that proof. But to do him
justice, he no longer needed it, and if he believed he
had read correctly a secret page in her life he knew
only too well who it was that had digressed farthest
from the prescribed line. Norman would have passed
him but he laid a detaining hand upon his arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I understand the attraction,” said Westcot,
“but no harm will be done if you will give me a half
hour first. We have been drifting apart, and I
would not have it so. Something has gone out of
my life, leaving it empty; and sometimes life itself
seems a burden. Will you assist me to make a
reparation?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A look of surprise overspread the face of the
young man. Then he hastened to say:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly I will. Have we not always been
fast friends in the past? I have no desire to let a
friendship of almost life-long standing die a death
so sudden.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then come,” said Westcot, and together they
wended their way through the grounds, and were
soon lost in the shadows. When they returned an
hour had passed. Both faces were perhaps a shade
paler, a shade more serious, but the old confidence
has been restored. What overtures had been made,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>what words spoken will never perhaps be revealed,
but firmly clasping hands Norman spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have my advice!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I will follow it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you! You have spoken like a man.
Under the circumstances I think it is the only way
that is open, and I am a poor judge of human nature
in general, and of women in particular, if such proceeding
as you now contemplate will not restore
peace and confidence to the little circle under your
roof.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With a last glance into the eyes of the other he
dropped his hand and entered the room where the
trio of women were trying to while away the hours
that were to bring at least one fair girl’s friend and
lover. Just as he stepped across the low French
window Imelda was running her fingers across the
key board of the piano. Cora was standing by her
side. Ere he had advanced more than a step a voice
of singular sweetness arose and filled the room. In
an instant more a second manly face appeared in the
frame of the open window. All unconscious of her
audience the girl gave full vent in song to the feelings
that swelled her breast. The notes rose and fell
and vibrated, until the very air seemed to be full of
life and feeling. With bated breath the men stood
and listened, forgetful of aught else but the rare
sweet music of the young pathetic voice; a voice that
possessed the power of carrying them away beyond
themselves. The song was a translation from the
German by Heine—the famous “Lorelei,” a selection
well calculated to try the strength and compass
of the voice that attempts it. Its weird and melancholy
pathos moved the inmost hearts of the listeners.
As the last vibrant notes died away the sound of applauding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>hands fell upon the ear, and hastily turning
the trio espied the two men standing just where they
had entered. A blush overspread the face of the
fair singer. It was the first time that other ears than
those of Owen Hunter had listened to the magic
sound of that voice when raised in song.</p>

<p class='c005'>With a quick movement Imelda stepped forward
and with outstretched hand greeted the new comer.
By the heightened color of her face and the happy
light that shone in the lustrous dark eyes Cora quickly
judged who it was that so suddenly had stepped
into their midst, and in a moment more was bowing
in acknowledgement of the introduction which had
followed. As she felt the searching glance the clear
eyes bent upon her Cora again felt the tell-tale blood
mount to her face, but with an effort overcoming the
embarrassed feeling she openly returned the look.
That which Norman Carlton saw within the depth of
the hazel eyes must have been satisfactory for, extending
his hand with a firm quick motion he said;</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am”——pleased, he was going to say but
changed it to—“glad to meet Imelda’s sister”—emphasizing
the “sister.” “I hope we may be friends.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you.” Scarcely above a whisper, and
with a fluttering breath, the words dropped from the
slightly trembling lips, and one felt, rather than
heard, the depths of feeling contained in the two little
words. In that moment Cora knew that she had
found another friend. His words were no idle
phrase. Imelda also understood, and her heart gave
a great bound. Did it not mean much? She took a
step backward,—she wanted the two to become better
acquainted. Would they have anything to say to
each other? A little while she would leave them together.
Turning to the side of Alice who was carelessly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>standing just a little beyond, plucking the
scarlet blossoms of a geranium to pieces, while her
glance traveled a little nervously to the man who was
still standing by the open window. What did it all
mean?</p>

<p class='c005'>For weeks now Mr. Westcot had studiously
avoided meeting his wife. His meals were either
taken late or away from home, and the drawing room
had not once known his presence in all that time.
Was the old life about to be taken up again? The
white teeth sank into the red lips and a tremor seized
and shook her form. She raised her hand in search
of a support. Imelda saw her reel, and with a quick
movement caught her in her arms. But another had
watched this little by-play, and a few strides brought
Lawrence Westcot to the side of the woman he called
his wife. Pouring a little ice water from the pitcher
that was standing near by he held it to her lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Drink,” he said. Quietly obeying she drank
a few swallows. Pushing a large easy chair forward
in such position as would shield her face from the
glaring light of the chandelier, he would have led her
to it, but she evaded his hand and managed to reach
it unaided. Bending over her he inquired the cause
of her sudden indisposition. Nervously she answered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing. It is nothing. I will be better in a
moment. The coming home of the girls must have
excited me. I thought I was stronger than I am.”
Was it an anxious look he bent upon her? He did
not speak, however, and quietly withdrew.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Cora and Norman had not seen any of this by-play. He had taken her by the hand and led her to
a tete-a-tete, and seating himself by her side soon
had drawn her into conversation. A group of exotic
plants was, by this movement, placed between themselves
and the others, and as scarce a word had been
spoken they were in ignorance of what had transpired.
Lawrence Westcot now raised his eyes to
Imelda who had stood during the scene without
speaking. She read in that glance a request which
he presently put into words.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you favor me with a few moments of your
presence?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Once before he had asked of her that question,
the memory of which sent the rich blood in hot waves
over her neck and brow. What did it mean? The
words she had uttered when in righteous indignation
she had swept from his presence now came back to
her:</p>

<p class='c005'>“And until such time, do not dare to speak to
me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Only once before had he “dared” to speak; that
was when she so unexpectedly ran into his arms.
Then it had not been of his seeking; but now? An
anxious look gathered in the sweet brown eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“Will you, please?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>The tone as well as the words were full of entreaty,
so, silently she moved forward a step and bent
her head in token of acquiescence. A glad light for
a moment lit up his eyes, then stepping to Alice he
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will excuse us? I will try and not keep
her long.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A look of wonderment filled her eyes. When
had Lawrence ever paid open attention to Imelda?
Again the question arose in her mind, “What does,
what can it all mean?” But she readily answered,
“Certainly, I will excuse you. I shall do very well.
I feel so much better now.” With a low “Thank
you,” he turned from her to Imelda whose hand he
took and placing it on his arm led her to the open
window leading to the veranda, followed by the eyes
of the surprised Alice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda understood, but only the quick indrawing
of her breath gave token that the idea of going
out into the open air under the starlit heavens had
anything unpleasant in it for her. Slight as had
been the sound and involuntary the action, Lawrence
Westcot had taken note of it. His teeth sank into
his lips but otherwise he gave no sign. Down the
garden pathway to the fountain’s edge whose silvery
sparkling waters had witnessed so many and so very
different scenes he led her, and then quietly dropped
her hand. Stepping back a pace or two he folded
his arms and confronted her. For a minute or more
he did not speak, although his lips twitched nervously.
Was he waiting for her to utter the first words? If
so, he was doomed to disappointment for the proud
lips did not open.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Ellwood!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>A slight uplifting of the head, that was all.
Whatever he had to say, she would not help him one
iota.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Ellwood, a man does not often find himself
placed in a position quite so awkward as that in
which I find myself this evening, in having asked
you for this interview.” He paused a moment ere he
went on. “Some two months ago I spoke words to
you that tonight I feel ashamed of. I approached
you in a manner that was ungentlemanly—unmanly.
For the feelings that had crept into my heart I make
no excuse. I simply had no control over them. A
hot, fierce desire and longing for something that was
denied me; a confused comprehension of what that
something was, made me unjust—and—cruel to the
woman who is so unfortunate as to be my wife.
Having through the merest chance overheard a conversation
of yours and hers, thereby gathering something
of your strange ideas and opinions, but utterly
failing to comprehend them, I permitted the passion
that had taken possession of me to have full sway.
A woman who does not believe in marriage, what
would you?</p>

<p class='c005'>“In my insufferable conceit I supposed I had
but to stretch out my covetous hand in order to
satisfy the fire of my passion. I was rudely brought
to my senses by the reproof of a pure mind and by
the righteous scorn of insulted purity. In an instant,
almost, I came to understand my mistake and would
have given much to have been able to recall my
words. But you had dealt my pride an ugly blow.
It was not an easy matter to humble myself to the
woman who had treated me to well merited scorn. I
had hoped time would close the breach and that this
painful scene would be spared me. Men of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>world are not wont to retract insulting words,
especially when defeated in their object. But something
besides wounded pride would not let me rest.
There is something here,”—touching his breast, “a
painful aching void that makes life a mockery, a
misery. The unmanly act of that evening is a burden
which at times is almost unsupportable. Will
you help me remove it? Will you say that you forgive?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He had spoken in hasty, jerky, broken sentences.
In a pleading manner he held out his hand to her.
But the girl stood with downcast eyes and did not
see it, and the hand fell nerveless to his side.</p>

<p class='c005'>Slowly she raised the white lids. In the uncertain
light of the starlit night he could not see into the
depths of the dark eyes, but as he bent closer he
thought they were dimmed, and that her voice was
vibrating as she now in turn extended to him her
hand and simply said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I forgive you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hastily the hand was grasped and bending over
it with the same pleading accents in his voice he
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“May I?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” came in soft accents from the trembling
lips. An indescribable sensation stole over her as she
felt the pressure of the warm bearded lips upon her
hand. A feeling of gladness filled her heart. She
felt that the emotion displayed by this man was
genuine, and that she knew she might safely trust
him. She laid her other hand gently over his that
was holding hers and softly spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is enough, please. I feel that you have
spoken the truth, in recognition of which I feel
bound to pay you honor. Let me hereafter see on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>your face the light of self-contained manhood. I am
more glad to be able to respect you, the father of my
two precious charges. Now let us return. Alice
was not feeling well and Cora may wonder.” His
only answer was to again kiss the hand that was still
resting in his; then again placing it upon his arm
together they retraced their steps to join their friends
in the parlor.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Imelda and Westcot re-entered the drawing
room they found Cora and Norman so deeply
interested in conversation that their entrance was
not heeded. Cora’s cheeks were glowing and her
eyes shone like twin stars as the words flowed in a
stream from her lips. Alice was sitting quiet and
unobserved in the shadow of the aforementioned
group of exotic plants, listening to every word that
fell from the ruby lips. Cora spoke well. Norman
had said but little, but that little to advantage.
Adroitly asking a question here and making a remark
there he had succeeded in drawing her out and was
surprised to find how well informed she was on many
subjects of which most young women have absolutely
no understanding. Cora had studied to advantage;
for with love to teach, it had not been so much a task
as a pleasure. It was also a pleasure for her to converse
with this refined and handsome gentleman.
Until now Owen Hunter had been the only man of
that type she had ever come in contact with. It had
seemed to her that there was none other. But to her
surprise and great pleasure she found that her sister’s
lover was in every respect the equal of the man who
until now had stood out in her life alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just as Imelda and Westcot were entering, the
poets, both American and foreign, were being discussed,
and Norman felt a little surprise when Cora
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>said that Shelley and Byron were her favorites. In
speaking of these he found her most familiar with
Byron,—“Queen Mab” being the only production
of Shelley’s she had as yet read, while he could mention
scarce any of Byron’s works that she was not
familiar with. When asked, which she liked best,
she unhesitatingly replied, “Manfred.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What! that gloomy pessimist, who continually
takes you to the very depths of despair, and finally
closed so tragically?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes. I like it because it portrays so truthfully
and vividly the heartaches that so often lie
hidden beneath the smiling exterior. It lifts the veil
and shows the hidden woe. Oh, why must all nature
be thus perverted? Why must all the grandest passions
thus recoil upon themselves? The story makes
me shudder as if I stood upon the brink of a chasm.
It chills my very blood, but it has a weird, strange
fascination for me. I always return to it and it has
done much to stimulate my dormant brain to action.
It has taught me a lesson in thought.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The re-entrance of Imelda and Lawrence at this
juncture brought the conversation to an end. A
hasty glance from Norman showed him that an understanding
had been effected. A quick look passed
between the two men and a feeling of gladness
entered the heart of Norman, for the sake of all concerned.
For a short time the conversation became
general, then Cora was asked to once more sing for
them. After a little hesitation she did so, and the
strains of sweet “Annie Laurie” filled the room.
No noisy applause greeted her when she had finished,
but every head was bowed and some of the eyes were
moist. The last lines had been sung with even more
pathos than the first, but the fluttering, quavering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>sound indicated something more than pathos. Cora
was fatiguing herself. In an instant Imelda recognized
the fact and hastily arising said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not another line. We have been forgetting
that you have been ill, and are taxing you beyond
your strength. Come, you must retire at once and I
will attend you.” But Cora shook the brown curly
head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No! no! I shall not accept your service this
evening. You will remain right here, while our
friend here, I know, will assist me for this once. Am
I right, Alice?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Most certainly. Right you are, and as we are
two to one, Queen Imelda is overruled. So just consider
yourself sent about your business while I shall
tuck the covers about this little girl’s form.” Thus
jesting and laughing Alice in triumph bore the tired
Cora off to her own domain. At the same time Lawrence
also discreetly withdrew. “To indulge in the
solace of man,” was what he said, to seek the companionship
of a cigar; thus leaving the lovers alone.
So many weeks had passed since an evening of undisturbed
quiet had been theirs that now they had so
much to say that the hours sped far into the night
ere they finally separated. After Cora and Alice
had bidden them good night and Lawrence had withdrawn,
Imelda said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look,” struggling from his embrace, “what
I have got! a long sweet letter from my Margaret,
with one enclosed from Wilbur. She says she is
getting along much better and faster with her studies
than she had at first expected, and she now hopes
that in the fall she may begin with her chosen work.
Listen to what she says:”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>My Own Imelda!</span>—To use the expression of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>gushing school girls, I am just dying to see you.
Save my mother and Wilbur, I have no one to whom
I can talk just what is in my mind. I have many
radical friends here, in dear old Chicago, but none
quite far enough advanced to admit them into the
innermost recesses of my heart. It is so hard, so
very hard, to replace a tried, a trusted friend. In
all probability this very circumstance is not without
its advantage as thereby I am better able to apply
myself to my studies. During the evening hours I
have an assistant and it would be natural to suppose
that during those hours my studies would progress
the most. But, strange to say, we continue to rehearse
the same first act—somehow we cannot get
beyond it—with some variation, it is true, but in
reality the same. I expect after a while we shall
surely be perfect. But of what the second contains
I am at present not able to give you an idea. It is
still a sealed book. To confess the truth however, I
care but little, so long as the first act gives such
exquisite pleasure, I am perfectly willing to let the
second take care of itself. All the same my arms
are in the best of trim to give you a good hugging—a
regular bear-hug. Maybe I can impress you. If
so, let me know.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you know I almost envy you your present
surroundings? You have so many to love now. No,
I don’t, either. That is not just the right thing to
say. Rather, I am glad, O so glad, that you have
found that wayward sisters of yours, that was. See,
darling, how our doctrines have been verified in this
case: that we are just what circumstances have made
us. Who would have thought that the wilful Cora
could be transformed into so noble a woman! But
then you know love works wonders, and undoubtedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Owen Hunter must be one of nature’s noblemen, else
the love upon which he fed the starved heart which
gave itself into his keeping could never have produced
such wonderful results.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, my Imelda, it will be yours to develop
the germ which this man has implanted, and when
they again meet—which I feel assured they will do—he
will not find occasion to regret the enforced
separation. And now, kiss for me that precious
sister pair who so truly belong to us. When your
letter came, telling us all about them, describing their
persons and characters so minutely that we imagined
that they were bodily transplanted into our very
midst, Wilbur could not restrain himself. His eyes
filled with tears—tears that with overflowing heart I
kissed away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O my precious friend, will the time ever come
when we shall realize some of our dreams, or will
fear, like a dark pall, always keep our heaven, our
paradise, enshrouded in darkness and gloom? When
these thoughts come to me I am sad. But you know
I do not approve of that. I shake it off; and indeed
I have not much chance or time to indulge in gloomy
thoughts, as hard work stands by and keeps my mind
busy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jesting aside, my rehearsing is not all play,
and my teachers are more than satisfied with me.
They have given me the best of hopes that I shall, in
the coming fall, be able to fill an engagement of
some note. They tell me my talent is remarkable
and that I must succeed. Professor Morris has
written to the managers of several first class companies
and daily expects an answer. Now, my girl,
please do not accuse me of what is vulgarly termed
‘self-conceit,’ but you cannot know what it means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>to me to be successful. I love the profession that
my talents fit me for, only second to that other
object that thrills my whole being. I love, O Imelda,
how I love Wilbur, the king of my heart. I love
humanity, the down-trodden, and I love the liberty
to do and to dare whatever my heart desires. And
among those desires by no means the least is my love
of the stage, despite the stigma that clings to it.
But where so great the stigma as that which has
fastened itself to the term ‘free love?’ or, for that
matter, to any other reform?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Two days later: The answer has come. An
engagement has been secured me and—Hurrah!
Imelda. In a few more weeks I shall be off on the
road to see how easy or how hard it is to win bread
and fame. If everything continues as favorable as
the beginning appears to be my success is already
assured. The vacancy that I am to fill is that of a
leading lady, and I know I must strain every effort
to please. My mother scarce knows whether she is
pleased or sorry. I am sure she is the best mother
any girl ever had, and while she is ambitious for me—while
she desires to see me successful, her heart
cannot conquer all its foolish fears. She fears the
men of the world, and the very fact that radical ideas
have been nurtured in my mind may bring me
danger. But she forgets it also has brought me a
knowledge that I could not well have acquired otherwise.
I have been taught by object lessons, and I
have learned to read character. It will not be an
easy matter to try to pass off on me the spurious for
the real, the genuine. Wilbur I know trusts me
more fully, and why should he not? Does he not
know that he is, and always must be, the best love of
my heart? Always? Well, until I find some one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>who has scaled the ladder of life to a grander manhood,
to nobler heights, he certainly will stand first,
and I know so well such men are rare. He is glad
for my sake that I have found an opening, but sad
when he remembers that it necessitates a separation.
He does not want to show the latter feeling, as he
fears to cast a shadow on my glad prospects, but
then you know, love is quick to note when every
cord is not tuned to harmony.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As yet I do not know at all where our company
will be booked, but I do hope that sometime
during the coming season we may stop for a week in
Harrisburg. Do you think such a possibility would
contain anything pleasurable?</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now—but no! I was going to tell you
another piece of news, but that will be Wilbur’s
privilege, as he, too, wants to write a few lines. But
I really must bring this to a close, or it might prove
a task instead of a pleasure to read it. Kiss all those
precious friends for me and say something nice to
that one particular friend who is not a friend but
something so much warmer, and soon, soon send an
answer to your homesick, loving—”</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Margaret</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Folding the closely written sheets Imelda looked
up into Norman’s eyes and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, sweetheart, what have you to say to my
Margaret?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That she is a precious, sweet girl, and a true
woman. I hope that she may indeed be successful
in her chosen profession. But what has our friend
Wilbur to say?” Without further comment Imelda
unfolded another document and began to read:</p>

<p class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>My Precious Friend</span>:—I wonder if, after all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>that our Margaret girl has written, I shall be able to
find something more to say. I am sure she has told
you all the news there was to tell and maybe if I
should write too lover-like, someone would object.
How is it? Do you think Norman Carlton would
grudge me the kiss which I am craving and longing
for? Methinks I read between the lines of the truly
grand letters he has been writing us lately, a broadening,
a widening out, that was not there at first. I
believe him indeed to be a grand, noble nature, possessed
of a high type of manhood. I am positive the
germ is there, even if yet somewhat hidden and undeveloped,
and it behooves you, my little girl, with
womanly tact to develop it that he may yet stand in
our foremost ranks, working for the universal good
of humanity and for the special good of sister woman.
I expect when we meet to take by the hand a
brother worthy of the name.</p>

<p class='c005'>“With his natural reverence for womanhood it
seems to me it ought not to be a difficult task for him
to understand the injustice, the unfairness, aye, the
cruelty that is being dealt out to woman; to always
doom her brain to slumber, to inactivity; to expect
her to stand with idly folded hands, denying her the
right to be her own judge pertaining to matters of
womanhood; deeming her incapable of understanding
her own affairs; dooming her always to submit
quietly to what man may wish to impose upon her;
using her as a pretty plaything with which to amuse
himself in any manner man may see fit. O it is horrible
to place woman, the creator, the builder of the
race, on a plane so low, and I cannot think that Norman
Carlton fails to see these things in their true
light.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is wrong to seek to bind love in any way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>and, try as we may, it cannot be done! Love, the
spirit, will ever be free. ’Tis only the body, the
house, the casket, that we can fetter and defile, and by
that means it, the body, becomes but an empty casket,
which will soon fall into decay when it has nothing
to sustain it, while the little love-god goes wandering
on and on mocking and laughing at our futile
attempts to hold him fast.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then why should such attempts be made?
Cherish him with tenderness, strive to stand high in
his regard, strive to attain to a noble manhood and
womanhood and he will forget his gypsy habits, his
proneness to wander. Feed and nourish him with
that of which he is most in need; develop for his
especial benefit that in your own character and nature
which commands respect and admiration, and you
will find him willing to be held in his allegiance.
You can do much to win him but you cannot hold
him by force, because there is absolutely no holding
him. It cannot be done, and it is wrong,—it is a sin
and a shame, a crying shame, to attempt it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ha! ha! On the old track again! Always the
same; always preaching; but I cannot help it, my
dear. It seems to have become my second nature.
But now I have a piece of news for you. Margaret
did not tell you all.</p>

<p class='c005'>“When this fair lady-love of mine will have
taken to walking her own way I know there will
come many weary lonesome hours, for the coming
winter, so we have been laying some plans how to
make them less irks me. Maybe it is premature to
say what these plans are, as much may happen to
prevent the realization; but here they are:</p>

<p class='c005'>“About the time you expect sleighing in your
eastern city, I intend, in company with our fair Margaret’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>mother, to set out on a trip. Do you understand?
My heart yearns for those precious sisters of
mine, mere babes almost they were when I saw them
last. I want to clasp them in my arms and kiss their
lips, red with the wine of life; while Mrs. Leland, I
know, will win a place in the heart of every one with
whom she comes in contact. Yet I believe there is a
particular reason that actuates her in making this
trip. There is a secret yearning and longing that
will not be quieted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By writing of the accident which reunited you
with your sister you aroused her mother heart by
bringing before her mind’s eye her son Osmond.
The hope to again call her boy her own is the mainspring
of the desire to make this visit. How is it,
little girl? Shall we be assured a welcome? But
there! I ought not to have asked this last question.
It was out of place, for of course we shall be welcome.
But methinks it is time to close or I will have
covered as much paper as Margaret has done, and it
is not my desire to weary you. With the same cherishing
love as of old, I am as ever</p>

<p class='c004'>Imelda folded these sheets also and laid them to
the others, but Norman did not speak. With his
head leaning on his hand he sat staring into vacancy,
Imelda gently, tenderly took his head between her
hands and bent it back so she could look into the clear
blue orbs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what does my Norman think of Wilbur
now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That he is right in every instance.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The brown curly head was resting on the snowy
pillow. The maimed arm had been tenderly cared
for, and already the tired eyes were drooping. It
had been such an exciting day. So many changes
had taken place. Cora’s heart had been stirred to its
very depths and it was a relief to be at last alone.
Alice was bending above her, and to bestow her a
good night kiss upon the faintly smiling lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good night, dear one. I hope you may spend
this first night within the walls of this home in restful
sleep. I, too, am tired and wish to rest. If you
should require anything, ring this bell, and I know
Mary will instantly attend to your wants. The fact
that you are Imelda’s sister will alone insure you the
entrance to her heart.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O thank you! thank you ever so much. Everybody
is so kind to me. I do not deserve it, I am
sure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O yes, you do. How can you speak like that?
And now once more, good night.” Two pairs of
warm clinging lips met in a loving kiss, then the
form of Alice vanished, and Cora was alone. In but
a few minutes sleep had closed the tired eyelids and
happy dreams brought sweet smiles to the rosy lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice glided quickly through the silent hall until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>she reached her own cozy, comfortable room. It was
in utter darkness, which fact, however, did not intimidate
her in the least. At times she rather liked
the darkness. It was then so pleasant to sit at the
window star-gazing, and let her thoughts wander
whithersoever they would. So she crossed the room
to where a comfortable rocker was standing, and
sinking into its depths with a weary sigh, she prepared
herself for her favorite indulgence. Hastily
undoing the fastenings of her dress she then clasped
her hands above her head, gazing up into the starlit
heavens, gently rocking back and forth in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly she stopped and listened. It seemed to
her there was someone else in the room. She could
have sworn that the sound of heavy breathing had been
borne to her ear, though now that she listened, everything
was quiet. But the feeling of another’s presence
seemed conveyed to her in the air itself—she
felt it. With a quick nervous movement she rose
and walked across the room. She could feel her
very lips grow cold, but with a strength and courage
of which one would scarce have believed the little
woman capable, she controlled every outward manifestation
of fear, and securing a match she deliberately
struck it and, mounting a chair, lit two jets ere
she ventured a single look about her; then with a
smothered, frightened cry she would have fallen had
not the man, whom she had seen and recognized,
caught her in his arms and prevented a mishap.
Gently he lifted her down and reseated her in the
rocker at the window. He, too, was pale, white to
the very lips, as he saw the impression his presence
made upon the pale little woman. He stepped back
a few paces and waited for her to speak, and when no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>sound came he hesitatingly, in trembling accents,
articulated her name.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Alice!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But her only answer was a frightened look.
Holding both his hands to her in a supplicating manner,
venturing a step nearer,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Alice, am I never to be forgiven? Listen to
me! If ever a man has been thinking—if ever it has
come to a human heart, or understanding, that a
great wrong has been committed, it has come to me.
I know I have wronged you. I know I have acted
like a brute! But I would, in some way or measure,
make good the wrong I have done.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The hands of Alice were closely pressed upon
her wildly beating heart. Her lips were twitching
in a manner that caused Lawrence’s heart to give a
bound. In a moment he had forgotten that he was
the supplicant. He knelt at her side and caught
both her hands in his, pressing and chafing them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Alice! Alice! little girl. Don’t look at me like
that. You need not be afraid of me now, or ever
again. I mean every word that I say. Come, trust
me! It is the one boon I ask”—and he gently drew
the excited little woman nearer to him, winding his
arm about her as tenderly as of yore. Laying his
face to hers, his lips touched the pretty pink ears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Little sister,” he whispered, “can you, will
you once more trust me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Little sister?” Had she heard aright? What
was the meaning the words conveyed? A hysterical
sob broke from her lips, and as she permitted him to
enfold her in his embrace, with an impulsive movement
she placed her hands on either side of his face,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lawrence! Lawrence! do you mean it? You
have not come to mock me?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>“I mean it, little girl, every word of it. Henceforth,
you shall be my dearly cherished sister, with
just the same liberty and privileges I would grant to
her, were you really a sister and dearly loved as
such.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A few moments she leaned back that she might
the better look him in the eyes. Then she wound her
arms about his neck and nestled her head close upon
his breast and the words,</p>

<p class='c005'>“I love you, Lawrence,” thrilled him to his innermost
being. He understood well the meaning of
those words. He had called her sister, and he knew
the love she gave him now was the same as every
pure woman gives a dearly loved and cherished
brother.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c005'>Once again a week had passed, and again merry
laughter resounded through the rooms. Happy
voices were heard blending in song while skillful
fingers evoked sweet strains of music. But faces
which were new within these rooms—though not new
to us, were revealed in the bright light. Edith and
Hilda Wallace had found their way into this enchanted
circle tonight. Alice was seated at the piano.
Her fingers lightly running over the keys, playing
the accompaniment to Cora’s rich sweet voice as it
rose and fell in the cadence of sweet strains of song.
The two were like a world unto themselves tonight,
paying little attention to the others, each of whom
was absorbed in giving attention to someone else.
While Hilda actually seemed to fascinate Lawrence
Westcot,—so absolutely was his attention riveted
upon the sweet serious girl who possessed such a fund
of knowledge that he thought he never had been so
rarely entertained, Edith had taken Norman Carlton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>in tow, and by her serene and placid manner had
so captivated him that for the past hour he had
actually forgotten his queenly Imelda, who in her
turn was talking just as seriously to a smooth-faced
boy whose bright, intelligent countenance was a perfect
mirror of the emotions that were being stirred
within that young breast. Sometimes the blue eyes
flashed, and with a quick peculiar motion of the hand
he would toss back the fair hair from the white open
brow; then he would ask question after question that,
with never failing readiness, Imelda would answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wait right here,” she said, “I will return in
an instant,”—and in a very short time Imelda reappeared,
carrying a small package in her hand. Before
undoing it she laid her hand on his.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I may call you Osmond, may I not?” The
clear eye met hers in a responsive glance; in turn he
laid his hand over hers and in a tone which had a
hearty ring he replied:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly! It will afford me the greatest
pleasure to have you do so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Reseating herself in the chair she had a few
moments ago vacated, with deft fingers that were
slightly trembling, Imelda undid the cord that bound
the package. The next moment Margaret’s sweet
face was brought to view. The boy’s hand trembled
as he reached for it, and in his face was reflected the
emotions that were stirring his young soul. Imelda
watched him closely, as for a long time his eyes were
riveted on that fair reflection, and when with a fluttering
long drawn sigh he laid it aside without comment,
she also said nothing, but handed him a second portrait;
this time the face reflected being that of Mrs.
Leland.</p>

<p class='c005'>It seemed almost Margaret over again, the resemblance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>was so great; only where time had touched
it; the years having left their trace—but only lightly.
The brow was just as smooth as that of the young
girl, the eye as clear and sparkling; the hair dark
and full. But there was a line about the expressive
mouth,—an expression on the face that was not on
the younger one, and which only experience could
have stamped thereon. It seemed to the boy standing
there, holding in his hand the picture of his
mother, as if in the eyes gazing at him there was a
pleading, yearning look that went straight to his
young heart. His sensitive lip quivered and with
another sigh he laid this picture also down. He kept
his eyes downcast as if he dared not look into those
searching dark orbs that were so eagerly fastened
upon him. In a little while a woman’s soft hand was
laid upon his and——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Osmond,”—a pleading voice spoke,—“do
either of those faces portray aught but purity? Do
you think your mother” (laying her hand on the
picture), “with a face like that, could be capable of
anything but what is good and pure and noble?”
His eyes were raised to hers, and they were dim with
unshed tears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know. But my brain seems reeling.
When I look at the face of the girl you say is my
sister a feeling comes to me as though I should be
proud to proclaim her as such to the world; while she
who is my mother seems to draw my very soul from
me. Looking at them both a feeling overcomes me
as if I had lost something to which I had a right, but
which has been withheld from me. But when I recall
all that which my father has told me of bygone
years it seems as if they were handsome, glittering,
fascinating serpents looking up at me, luring me from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>my allegiance.” Imelda took both the boy’s hands
in hers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look at me,” she said. “In the first place,
tell me—do you think I could be guilty of all the
cruel, unholy things that have been reported of your
mother?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, no! no! A thousand times no! It would
be impossible. One look into your face, into your
eyes, would convince me of that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you! but do you think, my young friend,
that I could hold one near and dear who is so vile as
you have been taught to believe your mother to have
been? Now listen: I do not want you to take my
word for all that I have told you of these my best
friends. Only wait, come here often. Here you can
become acquainted with the sentiments that fill your
mother’s whole heart and soul, and which find a reflection
in every word uttered by your fair young
sister. You seem, despite all the prejudices with
which your young life has been poisoned, to yet have
remained pure in heart. You are brave and truthful.
Now from this time forth in justice to your
mother, study your father; his modes of life; his
sentiments; his every action, and compare it to that
which he has told you of the woman who, being the
mother of his children, ought to be shielded and protected
by him from every breath of scandal; instead
of which protection he has blazoned such awful tales
about her that it takes almost superhuman courage
and bravery on her part to live them down. So I
ask you again, in justice to the woman who is your
mother, will you henceforth keep your eyes open?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A dark wave of color swept over Osmond’s face,
then with outstretched hand, he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I promise you that I will!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>This conversation closed, the pictures carefully
laid away, their attention was called to the other occupants
of the room. The first words that greeted
their ears fell from the lips of Hilda. They listened.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You speak of the prevailing spirit, of too little
charity of man to fellowman,” said Hilda, “and
again of single instances where charitable deeds rise
to the heights of grandeur, only regretting that they
are too few, too rare to be of any real value to humanity.
Aye! they are indeed too rare; but I do not
believe in charity. I do not like her. I have no
room for her. Does she ever draw near to the side
of justice? Is her garb not rather a cloak wherewith
to hide all the abounding and heartless cruelty which
seizes and retains the lion’s share of the product of all
the weary hours of toil that produce the wealth
wherewith these deeds of charity are done?</p>

<p class='c005'>“But that is only one kind of charity. That
charity which is supposed to overlook, to condone,
and even to justify what society treats as faults and
sins—O, how I hate it! For while charity pretends
to do all this, in reality it condemns every idea, every
thought, every action that is not in strict conformity
with the prevailing standards and customs of artificial
society. Charity enchains liberty; it blindfolds
and fetters justice. No! a thousand times no! I
scorn charity, no matter in what garb she may seek
to approach.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hilda’s dark gray eyes shone with a lustrous
light as she finished her animated speech. Imelda
thought she had never seen her so attractive.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bravo, little girl,” she exclaimed, “your
words ought to inspire brave hearts to noble deeds.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hilda blushed as she replied,</p>

<p class='c005'>“O no, I do not aspire to so great honor; but at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>times I feel I must give way to my feelings. They
oppress me so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you permit me to ask a question?” It
was Lawrence who spoke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A dozen if you wish.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then tell me what would you put in place of
charity which you so discard? You cannot but
acknowledge that there is great need of a helping
hand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, Mr. Westcot. Had you tried for
a week you could not have asked a question that
would afford me greater pleasure to answer. ‘What
would I substitute for charity?’ Why, Justice!
Justice every time. Where Justice reigns there can
be no place for charity. She will not be needed.
She will have lost her vocation. Let justice be done
to the great masses, to the struggling individual, and
where would there be occasion to call for the assistance,
the services, of the haughty dame with her
mock humility? None whatever! Where plenty
and peace have found a home there will be no occasion
to air her gaudy plumage. And in a short
time her very name will have assumed a strange
sound. Aye, it would be forgotten from little usage;
would become extinct, obsolete. Once pushed into
the background she would quietly step down and out
and be heard of no more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And,” added Edith, “with the advent of justice
and the exit of charity another thing would become
extinct, and that is power—the power of money.
When justice is done, the toiler, the producer, receiving
the full value or equivalent of his labor, it would
be impossible that a few favored idlers should grow
fat—in wealth and ease, while the masses starve.
No more strikes, no more robbery, no more bloodshed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Peace, happiness, prosperity—would not that
be an ideal world?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Here the refrain was taken up by Imelda.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No strikes, no robbery, no bloodshed! Do we
properly consider the full import of these words?
We hurl the curse of baseness, of low and brutal instincts,
we charge the birth of vice, crime, hatred and
what not, all upon those who toil and produce. If
in a measure it is true that the very air surrounding
this class of humanity is often pregnant with all the
elements that breed a state of things so depraved, is
it to be wondered at? Let us take into consideration
what the women of the despised classes are called
upon to pass through. Let us ask the why and
wherefore. When hunger and starvation stares her
in the face; when the demon drink has entered her
home; when the husband and father is thrown out of
work through no fault of his; when the monster
monopoly has shed precious blood, and made her
home desolate—what then, think you, breeds in the
heart of woman? Her every thought, her every
breath, must of necessity be freighted with—murder!
Then the little helpless unborn, the human embryon,
that is being gestated and fed with such nourishment—must
not a race of murderers, of criminals of every
description, be the product of such creative conditions?</p>

<p class='c005'>“When mothers are free to choose the fathers of
their babes; when they can have just the conditions
their hearts long for; when they can be free from
care and anxiety; when every woman has learned the
science of becoming a perfect mother; when every
mother understands the fearful responsibility of becoming
such; when every father is filled with a sense
of the high honor that has been conferred upon him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>in being chosen to be such; when, in consequence, he
recognizes the duties he owes to woman and her offspring,
and when, in every act of his life he seeks to
aid her in perfecting the coming being; then, and
not till then, may we expect peace and joy and happiness.
And to bring about such a state of things
justice must be done.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Strange words these, that fell for the first time,
upon the ear of young Osmond Leland. He heard
thoughts expressed that struck him as grand, lofty,
sublime, but—but—did they not savor of—well, the
insane? Was there any sense in dreaming of such
impossibilities? As each of these young ladies in
turn had spoken they had appeared to him as though
surrounded with a halo, such a sublime light had
shone in their eyes. But again, it seemed, to him,
as if their reasoning was devoid of reason, and his
mind reverted to the discarded figure of charity. He
could conceive of no other way to reach the suffering
masses. Until now he had scarcely thought of it.
But now? What sort of women were these that
could express themselves thus? What was it Imelda
had said?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wait, and come often. Here you can become
acquainted with the sentiments that fill your mother’s
heart and soul, and that find reflection in every word
uttered by your sister.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He could not comprehend the reasoning of these
young women, but the air surrounding them seemed
so truly holy and pure; such as had never been his
fate to come in contact with. And his mother and
sister?—Were they as these? Had he much to forgive
his father for? He felt dazed. Was this also a
case where gross injustice had been done?</p>

<p class='c005'>“But how, young ladies, would you make all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>your grand ideas practicable?” asked Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By proclaiming liberty,” answered Hilda.
“Liberty will insure justice, and justice liberty.
The two combined will make truth possible. To be
truthful is to be natural, and nature is pure, nature
is chaste. Only think what it all would mean to be
free! We hear the cant of freedom, of liberty, of a
‘free country,’ all around us, when in reality it is
all a miserable sham! Every word must be guarded,
every action fettered. We must eat, drink, sleep,
walk and talk all according to a prescribed fashion;
must bow to fashion, to custom. We may not even
welcome a child to our arms when we desire it, unless
we have first allowed shackles to be placed upon our
freedom; unless we have first bartered our womanhood
for motherhood—often turning what should be
a priceless boon to a most bitter curse.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hilda’s eyes were sparkling with brilliant flashes,
but the eyes of Cora, who with Alice had drawn near,
were downcast, and on the dark lashes clung two
pearly drops. Music and song had ceased; the two
performers, Alice and Cora, had for some time been
listening to the soulful words that were being spoken.
The sweet lips of the agitated girl were quivering as
with pain, her hands tightly clasped as she repeated,
“turning the precious boon so often into a bitter
curse.” Turning to Hilda and kneeling at her feet
Cora laid her face upon her knee.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is the curse never to be lifted?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes! When woman is ready to be blessed;
when she has learned to keep herself pure; when the
sacred temple of her body no longer is invaded by the
curse of lust; when man no longer dares to intrude,
to force his unwelcome attentions upon her, but patiently
bides his time at a respectful distance.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“You speak of the ‘millennium,’ of the perfection
of the race. Must our lives be one long sacrifice
to secure that end?” Hilda shook her head as with
both hands she lifted the tear-wet face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope not! Whilst we all have a work to
perform in the meantime, I believe we may yet be
able, in our own lives, to so far lift ourselves out of
and above all the pains that make life such a weary
round of toil, as to be able to enjoy just a little in
advance, of what the coming future will bring the
now enslaved race. When we are brave enough,
when we are strong enough to live as our inmost
convictions tell us is right and true and pure, we may
then hope for a little happiness, or perhaps a great
happiness, just as we make ourselves ready to receive
and appreciate it. And I feel so sure, so sure
that here, just right here around us, a band is forming,
true and staunch, that by its unity will enable
us yet to realize what now seem but dreams!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are speaking of that ideal home of yours?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes! If only—if only—I could once see the
way clear as to where the means are to come from.
Money! ‘Filthy lucre,’ as it is called, I fear is the
rock that will upset our plans.” But now Cora’s
eyes were shining.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Money, money,” she murmured. “I think I
know who would furnish it—only, will he not spurn
me now after I have disappointed him so, and
brought the bitter pain to his heart? O, will he believe
that it was all for love of him and not for myself
that I seemingly flung aside the priceless treasure
of his love?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If it is really that; if his love is a priceless treasure,
he but awaits the call and you will find him at
your side.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“And she,” murmured Cora “whom the law
gives to him and him to her,—she will never willingly
give him freedom.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wait and you will see!” came the assuring
answer. “Somehow I feel that all will be as we
desire.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Neither of the men could quite understand the
last words that passed between the girls, but Norman
understood enough to know that whatever
might be their meaning no ignoble subject would be
thus discussed. Lawrence Westcot shook his head,
but trusted. He was beginning to find these girls
very trustworthy. Only Osmond felt as if standing
upon some unseen brink. Hilda’s enthusiastic words
and manner had not been clear to him. He had
caught the words but not their full import, and yet—what
was it she had been saying about womanhood
being sacrificed, of being “bartered”? Had she
meant that marriage necessitated such sacrifice? But
surely, surely she had not meant that a child could
be welcome without the marriage blessing—a child
outside the sacred fold of wedlock? In a dazed manner
his hand went up to his head. “Here you can
become acquainted with the sentiments that fill your
mother’s heart and soul, and find a reflection in every
word uttered by your sister.” As with a red hot iron
the words seemed burned into his very soul. These
his mother’s sentiments? This his sister’s religion?
His eyes rested upon the faces of the girls; a sweet
purity was reflected upon each while Hilda appeared
surrounded with a halo. Some strong impulse drew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>him closer to them; he felt uplifted, borne upward,
floating in cloudy mists—a feeling of widening, expanding,
filled his being until the words of Hilda again
came surging in his ears, “we may not even welcome
a child to our arms when we desire it unless we have
first permitted our freedom to be shackled, made a
barter of our womanhood for motherhood, thereby
turning the precious boon into a bitter curse.” Blank
horror made his blood run cold; he felt as if an icy
hand was clutching at his throat.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it—are you not feeling well?” Imelda
asked the question and Edith’s soft warm hands
gently pushed him into the nearest chair, handing
him a drink of ice water. She understood perfectly
well what it was that ailed him, and feared they
might have repelled him so much that he would not
again seek their presence. So with her ready woman’s
tact she led the conversation to other subjects.
Music and art, the beautiful in general, were discussed,
and finally a request was made that Cora
should sing again ere they parted for the night. She
surprised them by singing a hymn. But all understood
there was a meaning underlying the usual import
of the words, “We shall know each other better
when the mists have rolled away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was with very mixed feelings that the good
nights were spoken, and as Hilda’s hand for a moment
lay in Westcot’s a look from his dark eyes
flashed into hers, a look that sent the warm blood in
a glow to her face, flooding it to the very roots of
her hair. Accompanied by the two young men, Norman
and Osmond, the sisters were rapidly driven
home, the pressing invitation “to come again,” still
ringing in the boy’s ears; and when at the door of the
home of this sister pair Hilda also held out her hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>to Osmond asking him to call there. After a moment’s
hesitation he placed his hand in hers and
promised.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c005'>Days and weeks had again sped on, each day
bringing its own events and lessons. The summer’s
sunshine had changed to the glow of autumn, and just
as marked had been the changes with many of our
friends. More firm had become the bond of friendship
and love that bound them together, more clearly
defined—because more clear the ideas, the ideals that
formed the central attraction around which love and
friendship clustered; day by day they understood
each other better, and also themselves better, and
their lives became purer, higher, nobler.</p>

<p class='c005'>But still they were waiting, waiting. They
recognized that their work was not yet done, but
pulses beat higher, eyes shone brighter, smiles more
radiant, as they were learning the old, old story over
again. At least several of our charming circle were
being blessed with that experience. Lawrence
Westcot’s heart was once more drinking in the lessons
of love, and his nature was broadening and expanding
under its influence, while Hilda seemed almost
glorified, as she moved about, soft snatches of song
dropping from her lips. Edith was almost as happy,
sunning herself in the reflection of her sister’s new-found love. Alice also saw and was happy. The
old child-like merriment had returned and the rooms
resounded with merry jests and silvery, tinkling
laughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>One evening when Alice had surprised Norman
in the gloaming she had not been able to resist the
longing, yearning spirit. Creeping up behind him
her little snowflake hands had closed his eyes. Ere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>he had caught the meaning of it a pair of warm dewy
lips had been pressed to his. Then she would have
fled, but quick as lightning her hands were made
prisoners and, despite the desperate struggles of the
furiously blushing little woman, she was drawn into
the circle of light where Norman in a most wicked
manner enjoyed her dire confusion. But presently
drawing her to him and enfolding her in his arms he
whispered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now for revenge!” The drooping moustache
brushed her face and for a little while Alice felt herself
smothered; so sweet, so clinging, so really in
earnest were the kisses which were pressed upon her
lips, and when a few minutes later she came flying
into the presence of Imelda, who had both the little
girls standing at her knees trying to teach them some
object lesson, the young instructress looked up in
some surprise at the disheveled figure. The fair hair
was tossed and its owner was pressing both hands to
her flaming cheeks. Ere Imelda could frame the
question that was trembling upon her lips Alice had
sank beside her on her knees and hid her face in her
lap.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t say a word,” she whispered, “until you
have heard what I have to say,” and drawing the dark
head down so that she could place the rosy lips to her
ear, she hurriedly whispered a few sentences and then
drew back to watch the effect. Imelda’s face betrayed
nothing; she only placed her arm about her
friend’s neck and for a few moments laid her face
upon the fluffy hair, then after kissing her repeatedly
she said, with a sweet smile:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe it is about time that these little folks
receive their evening meal and then to bed. So, for
a little while I must be excused.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>An hour later as Imelda was standing in the embrasure
of a window, a manly head bent above her;
an arm tenderly drew her head to be pillowed on his
breast while the whispered words, “My own, my
best beloved,” caused her own heart to beat in answering
throbs and a sigh of sweet content parted
her lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>Only Edith, in those days of pure happiness,
wore a look in the dark eyes that portrayed a something
hidden in their fathomless depths, a far-away
dreamy look that spoke of hopes not yet realized.
Sometimes when no eye was looking a suspicious
moisture would gather in the dark wells and for a
while would dim their glorious luster, but not for
long. Where there was so much warmth of heart
and joyousness of spirit it was not possible that one
whose life had been so practical would cast a shadow
upon the bright faces around her.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was yet one other whose happiness consisted
in dreaming of the future and waiting hopefully
and patiently what it might possibly bring, and
that other was Cora. But not in idleness was she
waiting. He should not have reason to think that
she had wasted precious time; so she had studied on.
Not only studied but already she was using her talents
to advantage. As soon as she was strong enough
she had insisted on doing something to be self-supporting,
and through the aid of her friends she had
been successful in obtaining quite a class of music
pupils, foremost among whom was Meta who gave
promise of future wonders. One hour in the early
morning, however, found her with another pupil, and
that pupil was Imelda. Much as she desired it Imelda
had not hitherto found the time and opportunity to
apply herself to this study, for which she possessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>a talent that surpassed even that of Cora, whose
music had settled in her throat rather than at the ends
of her fingers. More than once Cora had said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not long till you must have a more competent
teacher.” Thus the sisters daily grew more close
together with an appreciation of sisterly love in their
hearts such as is rarely known by those who have
been cuddled in the lap of fortune since their infancy.</p>

<p class='c005'>But there was still another—another growing
daily in light, in breadth and in intelligence. Osmond
Leland had returned again, and yet again, to
the charmed circle and was, as it were, born into a
new life. And as, day by day, he better understood
the sweet purity of these girls, so also did the events
in connection with his old life stand out in glaring
contrast. To his sorrow and dismay he found, upon
close investigation, that his father’s life was neither
pure nor truthful. Contrasted with the pure nature-love
and poetic beauty displayed in every word
spoken by these new friends the coarse and lewd
jests indulged in by his father and his companions
could not fail of effect. It was but a short time until
he felt his soul revolt at their ribaldry. More and
more he felt himself attracted and, still more often
he found himself seeking the society of the coterie of
fair girls who each in turn imparted their ideals and
dreams to the susceptible young heart, so eloquently
that it went out to each and all in answering throes,
and at the same time there was born in that heart a
secret yearning and longing for the mother and sister
who were as strangers to him. Often when he sought
the Westcot home at an earlier hour in the day he
had the, to him, rare pleasure of a romp with Alice’s
baby daughters. Norma would clap her chubby
hands and scream with delight, while Meta’s dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>eyes would glow and sparkle. But while Norma,
with all a baby’s delight of pulling her victim’s hair
would soon tire, and was content to cuddle up in his
lap where she would often fall asleep, Meta would
softly steal up behind and take possession of him in a
more gentle manner. Her soft little fingers had a
peculiarly tender touch as she patted his cheek and
toyed with his hair, arranging the blond curls into a
mass of ringlets. She would thus keep her fingers
busy for an hour or more, and never seemed to tire.
The dark eyes would have the same glad sparkle at
the end as at the beginning, and Osmond seemed to
enjoy the performance as well as the little ones. On
several occasions he had stretched himself out upon
the carpet when the serious bright-eyed sprite would
lift the fair head and pillow it in her lap and while
toying with his hair would put him to sleep. This
would afford her extreme pleasure. She would not
permit anyone so much as to whisper while she
guarded his slumber.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young mother and her girl friends watched
the play with amusement and pleasure. Was there
already a spark of the future woman in the little
child’s heart?</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus the autumn with its gorgeous colors had
come and gone. Chilly days and raw wet nights
were now in order, but the glowing fires in the grates
added to the cheerfulness of the rooms and the closely
drawn curtains closed out all that was unpleasant
and dismal. Then came the icy frosts and the first
snow and with it a letter from Wilbur announcing
the long promised visit to himself and Mrs. Leland.
Edith and Hilda were almost wild with joy and anticipation.
At last! at last! this so long, so sorely
missed brother coming home to his own, to clasp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>them in his arms, and they counted the days and
hours until he should be in their midst. But theirs
were not the only hearts that beat high at the contemplation
of the coming event. Imelda was scarcely
less excited than were the sisters. With a tender
cadence the name “Wilbur” lingered upon her lips,
but not for him alone did her heart beat with joy.
Mrs. Leland received no small share—her bonny
Margaret’s mother. And yet another heart beat with
a strange flutter in anticipation. Osmond, when told
of his mother’s expected visit, had turned white to
the very lips. Faint and trembling he had sunk into
a chair, and for the remainder of the evening had been
unusually quiet and absent-minded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it? Not pleased, Osmond?” The
boy looked up into Imelda’s eyes and she saw that
his own eyes were filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you know, do you realize what this meeting
may mean to me? My heart is going out in advance
to the woman who is my mother. I know I
shall love her. I know that I shall find her all that
my mind has pictured. I know that I shall find in
her eyes a new life; in her eyes and arms, such as I
have never known. But what else will it mean for
me? Great as has been the fall of respect for the
man who is my father, when I contrast his life and
teachings with what I have here been taught,—yet
for all that he is my father! That fact remains. The
forming of new and purer ties means the sundering
of some old ones, and although I can only win thereby
an untold amount of good, the fact still remains
that it hurts.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda’s hand gently passed over the clusters of
fair curls as she said,</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can but honor you for an emotion that is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>surest proof of a heart good and undefiled. I feel
certain that if you will follow its dictates you will
soon be able to judge whether it was affection for you
which caused your father to pierce your mother’s inmost
soul by depriving her of the child she had
nourished with her heart’s blood. Can you think of
more refined cruelty than to rob a mother of the babe
that has lain for months beneath her heart, and that,
with the most excruciating pain and with great peril
to her own life, has been born into the world? Do
you think a father’s affection can excel, or even equal,
the love of a mother? Then think of the years of
hungry yearning that have filled that gentle soul.”—</p>

<p class='c005'>The boy had not answered, but throughout the
evening had remained quiet, lost in thought. But
after that, day by day a restlessness had come over
him scarcely permitting him to remain any length of
time in one place. More glaring became the father’s
coarseness as with a critical eye the boy followed his
movements—his actions and his words. Often he
found himself remonstrating with him. At first
these remonstrances had elicited blank surprise, then
he had been rudely laughed at and taunted that he
must have fallen in love with some Sunday school
Miss.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s all right,” Mr. Leland had said.
“Couldn’t help being sweet on the little creatures
myself. In fact am so occasionally yet, but not to
the extent that it is going to interfere with any enjoyment
in life. Don’t be foolish, boy. Kiss the
pretty soft lips and tell her pretty nothings to satisfy
her; that need not prevent you from doing just as
you please; and by no means, let me tell you, will it
affect me. Girls are pretty playthings that help to
while away the time, but the man is a fool who permits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>one of them to affect him more seriously. I
have had a dose of it which I have no desire to have
repeated.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Fearing a tirade against a certain woman who all
unconsciously had grown into his affection he swallowed
his disgust and left his father to himself.
Judging his mother by those other women whose
“sentiments” were the same as hers he came to
wonder how it had come about that she could have
linked her fate with that of his father. He reproached
himself for entertaining such thoughts,
but yet was unable to banish them. And so it came
that often and still more often Osmond found his way
to the Westcot home. Sometimes he would also
wend his way to the home of the Wallaces, but as the
sisters had no control there outside their own sanctum
it was not quite so homelike and harmonious, not
quite so natural and free. More often he would stop
at their door only a few minutes to leave it a little
later with both sisters under his care. Thus it was
that time went by and the change, the most important
event in young Leland’s life, came nearer.——</p>

<p class='c005'>All day long the soft, fluffy masses had been
falling, noiseless, incessant, covering hill and plain,
and enveloping the world, as it were in one vast
winding sheet. The merry sleigh bells were tinkling,
but it was more work than pleasure to be out in the
soft yielding masses of fresh fallen snow. The hearts
of the young beat with glad anticipation of coming
pleasures, but older and wiser heads took it not so
lightly. They looked more seriously at the mass of
whirling fluffy flakes as they came piling down faster
and even faster until you could see scarce a half
dozen feet before you, while anxiety crept into many
a heart. And not without cause. Already every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>train was late, and there was much fear of trains
being snow-bound. In the evening, when in spite of
unpleasant weather our friends gathered at the
Westcots’ they wore very serious faces indeed. According
to the dispatch they had received, informing
them on what train the dear expected ones would
leave Chicago, they would be due in Harrisburg the
following morning at ten o’clock. If they had
started at the time intended they would in all likelihood
be detained many hours. If they were fortunate
enough to lie over in some city there would be
no harm done, but on the trackless prairies it would
be far from pleasant at the best. There was no music
and singing that night. Too much anxiety for
merry-making, and at a much earlier hour than usual
they again dispersed. Edith and Hilda’s hearts were
heavy as they kissed their girl friends good night.
So long, O so long they had hoped and longed and
waited for this brother to come, and now—Surely,
surely their fondest hopes would not be thus rudely
shattered. With a mighty effort the tears were
forced back and bravely they clung to cheering hope.
Just as they were about to descend the stone steps
leading from the front of the building, two strong
arms wound themselves about Hilda’s form and lifting
her bodily carried her safely to the waiting cutter.
Warmly and snugly she was tucked in by loving
hands and just for one moment a pair of mustached
lips touched hers, then the words were whispered
in her ear: “Courage little girl! be brave and
strong. Tomorrow evening someone else will be
claiming kisses from these sweet lips. Our precious
ones will surely come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was the first time Lawrence had put his love
into words and action, and the trembling lips of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>blushing maiden thanked him for the sweet cheering
words.</p>

<p class='c005'>Norman had performed the same office for Edith.
To save her feet from damp and cold he also had
carried her down to the waiting cutter and tucked
her in beside Hilda. Then taking his seat beside
Osmond, another hasty good night, and soon the
tinkling of the bells were lost in the distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Osmond was quiet; he had been quiet all the
evening. Scarce a word had dropped from his lips.
It is very doubtful indeed if the girls felt more
keenly than he the danger threatening the travelers.
The tension on his nerves drove him almost mad.
He dare not give expression to his fear. It meant so
much, so much—this coming of his mother. If she
should perish! With a sudden clicking sound he
clinched his teeth while the horror of the thought
caused him to close his eyes. Would he then be able
to say, “It was all for the best”?</p>

<p class='c005'>The dismal drive came to an end. The girls
were safely seen inside their home. Osmond was
next deposited at the door of his father’s dwelling
and shortly after Norman also was housed within the
four walls of his room. When the morning broke
the snow was still falling with a likelihood that there
would be no change very soon. The trees were
bending and breaking under their load and only with
the greatest difficulty could either man or beast move
about. Trains which had been due the day before
could not be heard from, owing to the fact that in
many places the telegraphic wires had been broken.
Evening again came, but as yet no news from the expected
train whereon our travelers were supposed
to be.</p>

<p class='c005'>About noon the fall of snow had ceased: a change
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>of temperature had set in; gradually it had been
growing colder until at midnight of the following
night the cold had reached an intensity which was
almost unbearable. This added greatly to the horror
of the possible situation of the travelers, and our
friends were in a fever of anxiety. With blanched
faces they moved about in their respective homes
scarcely able to endure the dreary hours of waiting.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again the night passed and another intensely
cold day was ushered in, and not until noon did any
news reach them. A message was wired from Pittsburg
that the train had been snow-bound in Ohio.
Rescue trains had been sent and in all probability if
nothing farther occurred to cause another delay, the
train would reach Harrisburg by Thursday evening
where it had been due Monday morning.</p>

<p class='c005'>Impatience must be curbed. Another night and
day must pass ere they could hope to fold their loved
ones to their bosoms. But tedious as the hours had
moved, the day was at last nearing its close, only a
few more hours and then?—Just as the clocks were
striking the hour of nine the puffing monster came
steaming into the city with its load of human freight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Heaving bosoms, concealing madly beating
hearts, were hidden under the heavy fur-lined wrappings.
In the excitement and bustle of the jostling
throng our waiting friends greatly feared missing
the travelers in the murky light, but just as the train
was again pulling out, Imelda espied a lady and two
gentlemen who seemed hopelessly seeking someone
judging from their hurried glances. Quickly walking
up, that she might the better look at their closely
muffled figures, she was recognized by the lady
traveler, and,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Imelda!” broke from her lips as she stepped
forward and folded the girlish form in her arms, kissing
her again and again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dearest Mamma Leland!”—and the kisses
were returned with interest. When released it was
to be again enfolded in a pair of stronger arms—this
time a perfect bear’s hug. Then followed hasty introductions.
Several more embraces, wordless, but
nevertheless speaking volumes, and then Norman
spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Save the caresses for an hour later; they will
keep, I am sure. This weather is not at all inviting,
so pile into the waiting sleighs; that we may go where
a welcome is prepared for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>“One moment,”—It was Wilbur’s strong pleasant
voice. “I make bold to bring you a fellow traveler
who has been of great value to us. Mr. Paul
Arthurs, I think deserves a better fate than to be
left to the tender mercies of a cheerless hotel on a
night like this.” These words were followed by a
hearty invitation and welcome. At first Mr. Arthurs
protested against intruding so summarily on perfect
strangers, but was shortly overruled, and a few
minutes later the sleighs were flying over the smooth
surface of the already beaten track, and in a very
short time the piercing night air was exchanged for
that of the warm rooms at the Westcot mansion.
Willing, friendly hands were assisting each of the
travelers to warmth and comfort. Mrs. Leland was
supplied a soft warm robe, a loose wrapper from
Imelda’s wardrobe. As there was no possibility of
procuring their trunks before morning, dry hose and
fur-lined slippers were provided for the weary nether
limbs. After a refreshing bath Imelda’s deft fingers
neatly and tastefully arranged the tired woman’s
hair. Then telling her that she looked ever so much
better than a half hour previous, she escorted her to
the parlor to find that the men had just preceded
them. Both the gentlemen guests had been supplied
from Mr. Westcot’s wardrobe, and they looked fresh
and bright enough to give the impression that they
were there for an ordinary social call. Wilbur’s
eyes lit up with a bright gleam as Imelda entered.
Without a moment’s hesitation he held out both hands
and drawing her close, held her face where the full
light of the chandelier overhead fell upon it—for a
minute drinking in the full glow of her beauty,
watching the rich color come and go in the fair
cheeks. Then taking the sweet proud face in both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>his hands he kissed the ruddy lips, once, twice, thrice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” he said, “I want to look at someone in
the——daylight I almost said; ’tis the gaslight, I
mean, which is almost as bright.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Norman was standing near, leaning with his
elbow on the piano, watching the scene before him
with a warm light in his eyes. Understanding well
who Wilbur’s “someone” was, he stepped forward
and extended his hand with a pleasant, happy smile
lighting up the handsome manly countenance. For
a few moments the black and blue eyes met, each
reading in the depths of the other’s soul; each satisfied
with what he saw and read there. It was a moment,
“When kindred spirits met,” when “soul
touched soul.” As they stood there, man to man,
hand clasped in hand, each knew and felt that he had
found a friend worthy of the name, and when a woman’s
soft hand was laid on theirs, as if in blessing,
it was Norman’s lips that touched the woman’s hand,
but Wilbur’s dark face was laid close to hers, and as
their lips met the whispered words fell upon her ear:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Imelda, gem of women, in this precious brother
you have found a jewel worthy of the finest setting.
You have been a sweet and successful teacher.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With the pure love-light in two pairs of eyes
reflected in her heart she turned to leave them together.
Little gushing Alice was just getting
through making Mrs. Leland welcome when the eyes
of the latter fell upon a sweet face, lit up by a pair
of dreamy hazel eyes. Something in the face struck
her as familiar, but she was unable to place it. The
girl saw and understood and was in the act of moving
forward when Imelda caught the look on Mrs.
Leland’s face. In a moment more she stood at Cora’s
side, laying her face to hers she said:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>“Do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do,” Mrs. Leland replied. “It is your
sister.” Here again after a few moment’s conversation
Imelda had the satisfaction of knowing that two
hearts, both dear to her, would meet and love.</p>

<p class='c005'>In glancing about she espied Edith deep in conversation
with the stranger, the traveling companion
of Mrs. Leland and Wilbur. He was holding her
hand in a close clasp and looking into the dark eyes
in a way wholly surprising in a stranger on such
short acquaintance. The color was coming and going
in the sweet face and her eyes had in them most
plainly an answering warmth. He certainly was a
very handsome man; one that any woman would be
apt to turn and look at again when meeting him in a
ballroom or on the street. Fair, with a light curling
beard and a free open countenance; tall and well proportioned
he was a picture of manly beauty. Edith
looking up and, seeing her friend’s perplexed and
wondering gaze, smiled and beckoned,</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are surprised, I see, at our seeming unwarranted
familiarity, but do you remember the day
when Cora made her first appearance downstairs
after the accident, and we were weaving such golden
plans for our future? Well you also remember that
Hilda spoke of a gentleman we had met in one of our
summer vacations in the mountains? I see you do
remember. I had thought the friendship of Mr.
Arthurs was to be only a pleasant memory when lo
and behold I recognize him in this traveling companion
of our loved ones, and to make the surprise
more complete, Harrisburg was his destination, as he
was coming here on matters of business and intended
remaining in the city for sometime.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda expressed her delight in finding in him a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>friend of her friends, and was about to move on when
Mr. Arthurs asked for Hilda. That maiden was discovered
serenely smiling and rosily blushing while
listening to some, from all appearance, highly interesting
tale of Lawrence Westcot’s. Edith forthwith
drew her new-found friend in the direction of the two.</p>

<p class='c005'>With a happy smile upon her face, reflecting the
sunshine of her heart in her eyes, Imelda was flying
from group to group when they suddenly rested upon
the sad face of a boy whose form was half hidden
in the heavy curtain of a deep bay window to which
he had withdrawn himself. In a moment she saw it
all. The boy had requested not to be introduced to
his mother at the depot. He would wait a more
favorable opportunity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It would only excite her,” he said, “and be
very unsatisfactory.”</p>

<p class='c005'>His request had been granted, but in the excitement
that followed he had momentarily been forgotten.
Not dreaming that her son might be among
this group of bright intelligent people Mrs. Leland
was giving her every thought to winsome Cora whose
heart was being drawn out to meet hers in glad
response.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda crossed the room to where Osmond stood.
His eyes filled with tears as she approached,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why so sad, my boy? Cheer up! Do you
think you are now ready to look into your mother’s
eyes?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My mother! how strange the words sound; but
I am afraid!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Afraid!’ Afraid of what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of the disappointment that may possibly fill
them when they rest on me. It would hurt if there
should be but a momentary reflection therein.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Imelda’s gentle hand lifted the chin of the boy
that was drooping in a dejected manner,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Those words that speak of the fear of a disappointment
show that you have not known a mother’s
heart. Come now and have this fear cast out,”—and
taking the trembling boy by the hand she drew him
from his hiding place and approached with him the
woman to whom he owed his being. Laying one
arm about his neck Imelda drew his face to hers,
with her other hand she touched Mrs. Leland’s arm
to draw her attention.</p>

<p class='c005'>“See! Mamma Leland. Who is this I bring
you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a moment of intense expectation. Mrs.
Leland quickly turned, and for a moment stared—then
gave a quick gasp. That face! Just for a moment
she had thought it was Margaret, so great was
the resemblance, but only a moment. His look was
strange and yet not strange. From his face she
glanced to that of Imelda, and back again to the boy.
She rose from her chair pressing both hands to her
madly beating heart. Her face became deathly
white. Slowly the boy’s hands were extended towards
her—an agonized pleading look lay in the large
blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mother!” broke from the pallid lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Osmond!” echoed the mother, and then she
folded her long lost child, her darling boy! in close
embrace near to her wildly beating heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>For a moment Mrs. Leland felt faint and dizzy,
then her pent-up feeling found vent in a flood of
tears, with which were mingled those of Osmond.
The tension on his nerves had been too great, but
both strove hard to conquer their emotions, and for
some time they sat in a wordless embrace, reading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>what they felt in each others eyes. Tenderly her
trembling hand smoothed the sunny locks and the
pearly drops again gathered in her eyes as she
thought how her baby had been permitted to grow
and develop, until he stood upon the brink of manhood
without the guidance of her hand. His boyhood’s
years—they had come and gone without bringing
her mother’s heart the privilege of watching
over the tender soul’s moulding. O, to have been
with him! to share his joys and to soften and smooth
his childish troubles.</p>

<p class='c005'>But now? Why dwell upon the past with its
many bitternesses and trials? Did not the present
moment outweigh all the sufferings? all the dark
hours of woe? Her boy was still her own, with a
soul pure and true. Should she not rather be thankful?
With an overflowing heart she drew the boy’s
face down to hers, giving vent to all the pent-up
feelings that were causing her heart to heave and her
lips to seek a loving, clinging mother’s kiss. Imelda’s
eyes filled with tears; without another word she
gently touched Cora’s arm and together they withdrew,
leaving the two to enjoy their new-found happiness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imelda drew her sister in the direction of the
piano, where Norman and Wilbur were still standing,
welding the friendship that was to last throughout
all the years of their after-life. With a little dextrous
movement the girls managed to reach the instrument
without attracting the notice of the men
and only when Cora’s rich, sweet voice filled the
room with joyous song did they become aware of
their close proximity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every voice was hushed, every word suspended
while she sang. Who was this girl, possessed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>such a glorious voice? When the music ceased and
the song ended Cora turned and faced her audience.
Wilbur was struck with the rare beauty of the face,
coupled with a strange sense of familiarity. Imelda
smiled, as she caught the puzzled look upon his face,</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is Cora, Wilbur.” That was their introduction—just
as a matter of course—feeling they
would need no other. But Wilbur was not satisfied,
and begged that Cora would sing again; and she,
nothing loath, did sing again. It was the first time
this week she had sung—with the anxiety for the
possible fate of the absent ones she had had no heart
to sing. But tonight she felt happy; so why should
she not? Turning over the pile of music her eye fell
upon “The Wandering Refugee.” The music was
sweet, if the words were sad; and as the sad, sweet
strains filled the room their influence was felt by
everyone present, toning down the exciting joy that
filled every heart. Just as the last notes died away
a rasping noise was heard at the window. Glancing
up they became aware of a white face being pressed
against the large pane. Only a momentary appearance,
and almost in an instant it was gone. But in
that instant both girls had seen it and—had they
recognized it? Both pairs of lips breathed the prayer—“I
hope not!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Such a wretched looking, such a deathly white
face! Imelda quickly moved over to the window, but
no sign was to be seen of a human being. Had they
been mistaken? Was it only a chimera of the brain,
conjured up by the sad, weird words of the song?
Heaving a deep sigh she turned away, shaking her
head to the enquiring sister. No one else had seen
the face at the window.</p>

<p class='c005'>At this juncture Alice claimed her right as hostess,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>and insisted that all should direct their steps to
the dining room, there to partake of a warm repast
which had been prepared for the hungry travelers.
Around the table another hour passed by in pleasant
conversation in which many a treasure of mind was
unfolded, and where bright eyes sent electric sparks
back and forth—sparks that were ever ready to
kindle love’s fire wherever they might happen to
alight, until at length, breaking in upon the running
conversation Westcot said,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will not someone be kind enough to relate the
experiences and dangers of the late journey?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Wilbur laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suspect they are greatly magnified—in your
imagination greater far than in reality. Snow-bound
we were; that is true enough; not a pleasant experience,
I grant you. By the storm-king we were
forced to remain in one spot, consumed more or less
with anxiety and by impatience to move onward.
The change to bitter cold caused us some suffering,
but being well supplied with wraps and blankets its
keenest edge was blunted. Perhaps the greatest
danger that menaced us was the lack of provisions,
but that also was warded off.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was night when our train was brought to a
standstill, and when the morning dawned we saw
only a vast unbroken field of snow, spread out before
our eyes. The outlook was far from cheerful. Not
having thought of such an emergency we had supplied
ourselves with no provisions whatever, and the
probability was that we would become acquainted
with empty stomachs before reaching our journey’s
end.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just opposite us across the aisle our friend
here, Mr. Arthurs, had taken his seat and, as misery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>loves company, it was not long ere he made our acquaintance.
Pardon me, Arthurs,” laughed Wilbur,
“I did not mean that you were so very miserable but
that we were all so miserably situated that your kind
heart prompted you to lighten our misery by coming
closer to us. Well, as the day wore on we all became
uncomfortably conscious that there were appetites
waiting to be appeased. The supply carried
by the train was not a large one and the steward was
asking shameful prices. Mr. Arthurs made the proposition
that we make an attempt at exploration, to
see if there were no human habitations near. At
first Mrs. Leland would not listen to such a thing,
fearing we might get lost, but her fears were overruled
and we made preparation for a tramp through
the deep and softly yielding snow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Following the base of a hill, near which our
train had stopped, we walked about a mile when in
the distance we discovered quite a village. It seemed
an endless tramp but at length we managed to get
there and make our needs known. The villagers
proved to be a rough but kindly disposed people and,
combining business and humanitarianism, some hours
later they brought to the cold and hungry travelers
a supply of hot coffee and sandwiches at reasonable
prices. This removed the deadly fear of starvation,
and although the temperature was very, very cold
our situation was endurable. Towards evening of
the second day rescue trains arrived. The snow had
been cleared from the tracks by the persistent labor
of many men who had worked night and day with
their shovels, and soon we were once more speeding
on our way rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By this time our new friend had proved himself
a friend indeed, and having made the discovery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>that his destination was the same as ours we invited
him to make one of our party. And to judge from
present appearances he is not at all sorry for having
accepted the invitation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Every eye turned in the direction of Mr. Arthurs,
at whose side Edith had found a seat. So deeply
was he interested, just then, in something Edith was
saying that neither had heard the closing remarks of
Wilbur, but at the sudden hush both looked up to
find all eyes resting upon them in smiles. A flush
mantled their faces, but, joining in the laugh at their
expense the matter was quickly disposed of, and now,
having satisfied their hunger Norman said he thought
it time they were seeking their respective homes, the
night being far advanced, and rest being much needed.
Both Wilbur and Mr. Arthurs spoke of going to a
hotel, which proposition was most strenuously objected
to by the Westcots who insisted that they
make their home with them during their stay in the
city.</p>

<p class='c005'>But to this neither of the young men would listen;
for this one night, however, they did not refuse to
accept the kindly proffered hospitality. Tomorrow
they would make other arrangements. Hasty preparations
were then made for the departure of the
others, and Mrs. Leland’s heart contracted painfully
at the thought of letting her boy go from her, even
for one night. But chiding her selfishness she gave
him a good night kiss. As Norman opened the door,
the outer vestibule door and was passing down the
stone steps he suddenly stopped. Across the lower
step a dark object was lying which proved to be the
cold and stiffened form of a man.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Norman’s cry of alarm soon brought the others
to his side. To the question, “What shall be done
with him?” Alice replied,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bring him in immediately.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So the inanimate form was lifted and carried
inside, not to the heated rooms but to one where the
fire had gone out, leaving it cold and chill. Imelda
and Cora stood with clasped hands, a frightened look
in their eyes; looking at each other, expecting what
they dared not think or breathe aloud.</p>

<p class='c005'>The body of the unfortunate man had been carried
past them without either having caught a glimpse
even of the white face, leaving them in cruel uncertainty
as to the identity of its owner. Norman spoke
of procuring a doctor when Paul Arthurs spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“With the kind permission of all present I offer
my service, as I am a physician.” This was news,
and under the circumstances a very agreeable surprise.
The offer was most gladly accepted. Requesting
Wilbur and Norman to lend their assistance Doctor
Arthurs began the work of trying to resuscitate
the seeming dead body, and for two long hours the
three worked hard and faithfully. When they had
about given up all hope of recalling the fleeting
spark the discovery was made that the blood was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>beginning to circulate while faintly perceptible respiration
gave hope of returning consciousness. After
a thorough cleansing the body was wrapped in a soft,
warm blanket and put to bed. The chances now were
that a life had been saved, but—to what end?</p>

<p class='c005'>The young physician had made a sad discovery,
one which indicated that the patient was at best the
victim of an incurable disease. He who lay before
them unconscious of his condition, was but a boy in
years but already a physical wreck, through the indulgence
of a most pernicious sexual habit. Hollow
eyes and sunken cheeks told the sad tale. The drawn
white face was encircled by clusters of dark, curling
hair; in health he evidently had been a handsome lad.
Now his appearance was anything but prepossessing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There we see the result of ignorance on the
part of some one,” spoke up the young physician.
“The ignorance of parents in regard to the meaning
of childhood, or the ignorance of a boy who did not
know, or understand, the meaning of life, and the
right uses of life-giving organs and forces.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Neither of the young men had a word to say,
but stood with eyes riveted on the ghastly face.
Why did that face seem so strangely familiar? and
while they looked this strange feeling grew. Like a
flash a revelation came to both and their eyes met in
a sympathetic glance. Norman became white to the
very lips. In Wilbur’s eyes was a troubled look, as
he met the glance of the other, but across that
motionless form he extended his hand to the other
who without a moment’s hesitation placed his own
therein. It was like a compact, this involuntary action,
and in that silent clasp there was something conveyed
that told to each that they had drawn a step
nearer to each other; that in the future they would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>stand still closer as friends. Wilbur turned to the
young physician, pointing to the prostrate form,</p>

<p class='c005'>“We have made a discovery!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And which is——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That this unfortunate young man is Frank
Ellwood!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Frank Ellwood? Who is he?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The brother of the sisters, Imelda and Cora
Ellwood.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah!” The word was long drawn and hesitating.
Paul Arthurs did not as yet understand; so,
briefly as possible, Wilbur related just enough to
enable him to grasp the situation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young doctor’s face became sad and overcast.
O, why is this young life blighted? Why
should this burden be laid upon those young
shoulders? But he felt it would not be for long.
Disease, with its fatal clutch, had fastened upon the
vitals of the young man, and it was only a question
of a very short time until the fell destroyer would
claim the victim for his own.</p>

<p class='c005'>When an hour later, with returning consciousness
Frank opened his eyes it was to find two fair
faces bending over him, faces wherein only love and
compassion were to be seen. While Imelda gently
brushed the dark hair from the pale face Cora took
his hand and laid her face upon it. In his weakness
he saw but did not understand. As if their presence
brought him peace and comfort he again closed his
eyes and soon the regular breathing told that he was
in the land of dreams. Gently, lovingly, the sisters
nursed the erring brother back to life, with never a
word of reproach for the wasted past. They understood
only too well their task would be of but short
duration, and when the paroxysms of coughing shook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>the weakened frame it was all they could do to stay
the tears that would well up in their eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>But soon the time came when he asked to have
their joint presence explained, and it was Cora who
told him all—all the bitter struggles and experiences
of both their lives; of the heavy overhanging clouds,
but which clouds were now beginning to show their
silver lining.</p>

<p class='c005'>Frank made no comment. He seemed broken in
spirit as well as in body. The once strong and
healthy young athlete seemed now only to desire rest
and quiet, and when the glad spring time came with
its new life and budding joys, its sunshine and song,
they folded the waxen hands upon the pulseless
breast, decked his coffin with the first sweet flowers
of spring and laid the emaciated body away from
sight.</p>

<p class='c005'>Poor boy! Wayward and reckless from his
childhood up he had plunged headlong into all the
vices that lure passionate youth from virtue’s path,
and yet—had he sinned more than he had been sinned
against? If he had erred, if he had gone wrong,
surely he had paid the forfeit. It was a heavy price,
that of his young life, and it ill becomes us to sit in
judgment upon him. Lawrence and Alice had insisted
that he remain an inmate of their home, and a
bright sunny room had been placed at his disposal,
where he remained until the end.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the meantime much of interest had transpired,
ere the dawn of that sad spring morning. On that
memorable night that had brought so much of joy,
and also so much of pain—the finding of the long
lost brother—our friends had separated as they had
at first intended doing, with the difference that those
departing had remained a few hours longer at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Westcots than they had expected. With the feeling
of uncertainty as to the fate of the frozen man none
experienced a desire to leave until the news came
that he would recover temporarily at least; and when
the suspicions of the sisters had proved to be correct—that
the unfortunate stranger was indeed their
brother, so long dead to them—then, as the hour was
very late, whispering words of hope the good nights
were at last spoken. The Wallace sisters with
Osmond and Norman as escorts were rapidly driven
to their home; Edith’s hand had been held just a little
longer and closer by the young physician than would
seem to have been necessary, and Mrs. Leland had
held her boy very close as though the separation
about to take place was for an unknown period of
time, instead of only one short night,—but finally
they were whirled away over the freezing snow, and
in due time deposited each at their respective doors.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Wallace did not often inquire into the doings
of his daughters. Long since he gave over the attempt
to control their actions, feeling that they could
well be trusted. On this occasion, however, the
hour had been so unusually late when they had come
home that he could not refrain from asking where
they had spent the evening, or rather night, as
was in the “wee sma’ hours” that they had sought
their room. A moment Edith hesitated, then,</p>

<p class='c005'>“At the Westcot’s—they are entertaining visitors
from Chicago, the belated trains causing us also to
be late.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Edith again hesitated before answering. Should
she tell the truth? It was extremely distasteful to
this pure-minded girl to speak a falsehood. She
felt she could not possibly keep the fact a secret that
her brother was in the city. The sisters exchanged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>a quick apprehensive glance, then endeavoring to
appear calm as possible Edith said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“The interest might possibly be greater than
you think, and you will perhaps agree with me when
I tell you that one of them bears the name of Wilbur
Wallace.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Wallace, who was just partaking of his
morning meal, arrested midway the cup which he
was about placing to his lips and stared at his daughter
as if he had not heard aright.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who? What is that you say?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wilbur Wallace,” repeated Edith with slightly
trembling voice. Slowly the cup that was poised in
mid air was again replaced upon the table.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you mean to say that it is your brother to
whom you refer?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A slight inclining motion of the head was
Edith’s only answer. She almost feared to look at
her father, and when she did so she found the strong
man had turned deathly pale; his lips twitching
nervously, and presently with a gasping sound came
from his lips:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wilbur! Wilbur!” and his head sank upon his
hand, in which attitude he remained a long while,
then slowly, without again speaking, he rose, donned
overcoat and muffler and went out into the crisp,
wintry, morning air. His manner was a mystery.
The girls looked at each other and shook their heads.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the evening when they again met at the family
table he looked more like himself but was strangely
quiet, not at all like the Elmer Wallace who was wont
to carry himself with an air of such importance and
assurance. Even his wife took note of the matter
and inquired as to the reason, but received no answer
for her pains.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>Several days thus passed by. Regularly each
evening after supper a span of horses with a dashing
cutter drove up to the door; a youthful driver would
spring therefrom and would carefully tuck the waiting
girls therein and drive away, returning always a
little before midnight. Then there was a change.
Beside the boyish figure a more manly one had taken
its place. Tall and well built, every movement of
that form betokened health and strength. At such
times the face of another and older man could be
seen at the window, watching the figure of the
younger man as he sprang to meet the girls. Eagerly
he listened to catch the sound of the voice speaking
words of greeting to the sisters, watched him tuck
the robes closely about them, heard his deep-toned
laughter mingle with their silvery ripples, and in a
few seconds more they would disappear. Long hours
would intervene, but when the tinkling bells announced
their return, as though it had been watching
for their advent, the face at the window was always
there, until the good nights were spoken and the
merry music of the bells was lost in the distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Mr. Wallace never asked for his son; though
deep down in his heart a longing was making itself
manifest. Now that he knew that his first born was
once more near him in the same city, to look into his
eyes, to clasp him to his bosom, to have a share in his
life, was a desire that was daily growing upon him.
Yet he could not bring himself to sue for it. Day by
day the longing grew stronger until it became almost
unbearable. This longing was the more
strongly felt when he glanced at his younger children,
the result of his second marriage. All of them, the
whole four, had not been sent, this season, to boarding
school, as they were not at all well, and they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>made life anything but pleasant for the rest of the
household. The eldest boy, Homer, the father had
hoped would soon have been ready to graduate, but
the lad showed an unaccountable aversion towards
his books. He was surly, sullen and irritable, with
a languor of manner that caused the parents to fear
that he might be breeding some fever. The others
were no better. Elmer was hollow-eyed and nervous.
The girls, Hattie and Aleda, were fretful and hysterical
to a degree that made life a misery to those about
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The parents were anxious and fearful, pampering
them in mistaken kindness, thereby making perfect
tyrants of them all. Only Edith and Hilda
would not submit to the whimsical demands of the
younger children, and when Mrs. Wallace complained
and lamented about the ill health of her darlings
Edith would reply:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Insist on it that they all take exercises every
day—exercise of a nature that will tax their strength,
and ere long you will see a change.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I am sure there would be a change. You
certainly are the most heartless girl I have ever met.
Compel my sick children to work? I believe it
would please you if they should die, for that is what
such a course would result in, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Wallace would look at them, then at the
bright and cheerful faces of his eldest daughters.
Then he would remember the face and figure of the
stalwart young man whose movements he had of late
been watching from the window and would wonder
how it was that the children of the delicate Erna
should be healthy and robust while these younger
children, whose mother was apparently so strong and
healthy, should be so delicate, apparently candidates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>for early graves. More than ever he longed to be
reconciled to his first born. But his stubborn will
would not bend. Had Wilbur come to him he would
have welcomed him with open arms, but that he
should go to Wilbur his iron will and stubborn pride
would not permit. So he stifled the voice of his
heart, only he could not cast out the longing therein,
and day by day he grew more restless, dissatisfied
and irritable while the state of affairs at home grew
daily more unpleasant.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day, it was clear and frosty, Mr. Wallace
was on his way home to dinner, walking along at a
brisk pace. Part of his way lay along the railway
track, when at a short distance ahead of him he saw a
boyish figure in which he recognized his son Homer.
The boy was walking at a very slow pace with downcast
eyes seemingly forgetful of his surroundings
when the rumbling of the wheels of an approaching
train was heard. The boy however, paid no heed.
Mr. Wallace gave a cry of warning but the boy was
so lost in thought that he never heard. The train
was approaching at an alarming rate of speed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Homer! Homer!” the distracted father cried,
but unconcerned the boy walked on. Mr. Wallace
started on a run but despaired of reaching him. He
repeated his warning cry when suddenly the boy
tripped and stumbled, almost fell—recalling him to
himself, but the nearness of the approaching train,
the certainty of impending fate seemed to stun him
and he stood stock still, with white set face, awaiting
the coming shock. Mr. Wallace calling again,
“Homer! Homer! quick, aside,” covered his eyes
with his hand so as not to witness the dread disaster.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next moment the train went speeding by,
sending the icy chills through his veins. Dreading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>to look up, expecting to see only the mangled remains
of his child Mr. Wallace with white lips and blanched
face, opened his eyes to see a stalwart, manly figure,
a face encircled by clustering dark locks, lit up by
piercing black eyes, and in his arms holding the half-fainting form of Homer.</p>

<p class='c005'>The revulsion of feeling was so great that the
strong man reeled, and when he saw and recognized
who it was that had been the savior of his boy a film
gathered over his eyes. He staggered as he made his
way to where the stranger stood, still clasping the
careless boy in his arms. Both hands were outstretched
to clasp those of the rescuer but the stiff
lips refused to articulate the words he would have
spoken.</p>

<p class='c005'>By this time Homer had recovered himself sufficiently
to free himself from the firm clasp, and to say,</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right, old man! No need of being so
scared. I have not gone to ‘kingdom come’—not
just yet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But not on the boy were the eyes of Mr. Wallace
riveted. As if fascinated they hung upon that other
young face while his own was working strangely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I presume you are the father of this young
man?” spoke a clear, full-toned, manly voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wilbur!” came in husky, broken accents from
the pallid lips of Mr. Wallace. “Wilbur, do you
not know me?”—in a hesitating, supplicating manner,
extending both hands to the young man.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wilbur started and changed color, retreating a
step and bending a searching glance upon the elder
man. “You are——my——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Father!” interrupted Mr. Wallace. “Yes, I
am your father, and the boy whose life you have just
saved is your brother.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>The boy gave vent to a long drawn whistle,—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Say, Gov’nor! this is news. Where did you
manage to have him stowed away all this time?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The face of Mr. Wallace flushed darkly red.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Homer, I am ashamed of you. You would
please me much by being a little less ill-bred.” Then
turning again to Wilbur and again extending his
hand,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you permit the past to be forgotten?
Must I ask in vain that my boy, my first born, will
lay his hand in mine?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The husky pleading of the voice touched Wilbur.
After a few moment’s hesitation in which the past
seemed to confront him,—in which he seemed to hear
the splashing of the icy waters of the Susquehanna
river as they closed over the head of the hazel-eyed
little mother, so many years ago—a shudder passed
through his frame; then his eyes fell upon the boy,
almost a young man, but with a sullen look on the
otherwise fair face, thereby marring its beauty—the
disrespectful manner towards his father, showing an
equally marred character. Then his eyes turned to
the face of the father who had so long been a stranger
to him, and what they saw there again touched his
better nature. No! it certainly was not the face of a
happy man. There were lines in it that the flight of
years alone had not traced. It looked careworn and
worried. Slowly, involuntarily his hand was raised
and laid in the outstretched palm whose fingers closed
about it almost like a vice. Several moments passed
ere Mr. Wallace had controlled himself sufficiently to
speak, then hurriedly, anxiously,—</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will go with me? I want you at home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Wilbur shook his head, but his father only held
his hand the faster.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>“I will take no refusal. For once I am going to
give Edith and Hilda a pleasant surprise. Come,
Homer, we will not keep them waiting at home for
us any longer.” Without answering the boy turned
his steps homeward, while Mr. Wallace drew Wilbur’s
arm through his.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will come I know, and the girls will be
happy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Half reluctantly and wholly longingly he permitted
himself to be led away and almost ere he knew
he found himself standing at the door of the well known
house before which of late he had so often
stood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Edith gave a gasp when she saw the noble
form of her brother enter the door at her father’s
side; but she welcomed him by laying her white
round arm about his neck and kissing him. Hilda
stood for a moment looking from one to another in a
bewildered manner, then a bright light almost transfigured
her face. Gliding to her father’s side she
surprised that individual by winding her arms about
his neck and pressing her fresh dewy lips to his.
Then laying her cheek to his whispered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thank you from the bottom of my heart.”</p>

<p class='c005'>What was it that arose in his throat and dimmed
his eye? When had a sweet woman’s kiss been
pressed upon his lips before. He laid a trembling
hand upon the back of a chair to steady himself
while his eyes followed the hazel-eyed girl—so like
the Erna of long ago. For just one moment it had
seemed to him that it had been she who whispered
that “Thank you.” That it had been her cheek
resting against his. A sigh escaped his lips as he
thought of how short duration had been their happiness.
Why had it been so short? Even now he
could not understand; but he felt a glow of satisfaction,
such as he had not known in many a long year,
as he watched the group of three. For the first time
a feeling of conscious pride swelled in his heart at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>thought that they were his children. Mrs. Wallace,
when she entered the room in her sweeping robes was
not exactly delighted when the guest of the evening
was introduced to her, but had enough of good grace
to tender him a kindly welcome when she heard of
the service he had rendered her own son. Besides
this splendid young giant commanded her respect
whether she would or not. She always did admire
handsome men, and Wilbur was decidedly handsome.
So once more—what he believed would never
again be possible—Wilbur found himself sitting at
his father’s table, partaking of his bread, of his hospitality,
and felt conscious that he was doing right;
knew that his idolized sisters sanctioned it. Both
were extremely happy and, conscious of that happiness,
Wilbur felt as if inspired, and talked as he
had never before talked. His sisters were proud of
him and his father was surprised and astounded at
the store of knowledge he possessed, at the ideas that
had possession of his active brain, and a new light
dawned upon his mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was, he now began to see, this brother who
had been the teacher of the sisters, developing them
into the splendid independent women that they were.
Even Mrs. Wallace became interested, although
most of that which he said was as so much Greek to
her.  It was of so foreign a nature to her.  She
found more to disagree with than agree to, yet she
found herself listening to every word. Stranger
than all, Homer was aroused; his senses were alert.
Where had he ever heard such doctrines propounded
before? Certainly not in such a strain. Yet he had
heard them, and with his mates of the boarding
school had jeered and laughed and scoffed at what
they termed “would-be-reformers.”  Now he began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>to see how much superior were these thoughts when
compared with the useless studies with which his head
had been crammed, and with the teachings of the
dime novels which he and his mates had devoured—inflaming
their passions and leading to the formation
of vile habits.</p>

<p class='c005'>While Wilbur was speaking he had been watching
the flushing and paling face of the boy. A suspicion
of what made him languid and nervous and
sullen forced itself upon his mind and he forthwith
made up his mind to take the lad in hand. He also
observed that none of the other children possessed
a healthy color, but with this one he was,
for the moment, most interested. He remained all
the afternoon, partaking again of the evening meal,
thereby causing him to draw still nearer to the slumbering
heart and senses of Homer; at the same time
winning his way into the hearts of all the others.
So when after supper as usual a double-seated cutter
drawn by a span of fiery horses came dashing to the
door, Wilbur surprised that young gentleman by inviting
him to join them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It will do him good,” he said, glancing at his
father.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus Homer made the acquaintance of this circle
which was to influence all his after-life. As soon as
an opportunity offered Wilbur drew young Arthurs
aside and had a prolonged conversation with him,
their eyes frequently resting on the pale face of the
boy. Presently Mrs. Leland was also drawn into the
conversation and when it ended all understood what
was expected of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Leland drew near the boy who was a
stranger in their midst, and in a pleasant motherly
fashion began to talk to him, gradually drawing him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>out, finding much intelligence stored away in the
youthful mind but which had all been going to waste
for the want of a guiding hand and skillful touch to
turn it into proper channels. Edith and Hilda
watched while a feeling of joy filled their hearts.
Was there really something more than self-will, indolence
and haughty overbearing in the nature of the
boy, hidden beneath that repellant exterior? Presently
it was Imelda’s turn to exert her gentle influence
on him in her bright, animated manner, and
when Cora’s voice filled the large room with a burst
of song he felt as if lost in a new world. The two
sisters knew he was taken care of, and in their turn
devoted themselves to the invalid. Poor Frank!
They had the satisfaction of seeing his face light up
and the color come and go in the wan cheeks. He
had learned to love the circle which nightly met here,
where naught but love seemed to reign, while Mrs.
Leland was almost worshipped by him. Was ever
mother so kind to erring boy before? If his own
mother—but here he stopped. She too had been erring,
suffering. She belonged to his wasted past. She
had been an over-indulgent mother to him, in spite of
her fretfulness and peevishness, and at this late day
he felt that it would be wrong for him to throw a
stone upon her grave. While Hilda toyed with his
white hand Edith was standing at the back of his
chair, smoothing back the clustering locks from his
brow. A sense of peace and quiet came over him,
such as he had not known in the olden days. Now
and then a much meaning look passed between the
young physician and the elder sister, calling forth a
warmer hue to the fair cheek. Hilda enjoyed the
same kind of by-play with Lawrence, to whom it
seemed impossible to gain more than a few moments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>at a time at her side, while Mrs. Leland was more
successful with her boy lover. When the good nights
had been spoken and our party was whirling homeward,
Homer was very quiet, He was deeply impressed
with all he had seen and heard, and his
thoughts were busy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next morning, earlier far than had been Homer’s
habit to rise, two strong, young figures appeared at
the door asking admittance, and sending the merry
tinkle of the bell through the rooms. Wilbur and
Osmond, ready for a hunting trip, had come to take
Homer with them. The boy was tired from being
out so late the evening before, and at first was not at
all inclined to join them. It seemed he could not
muster enough of will force to face the crisp morning
air, while Mrs. Wallace objected with all her
strength, being positively sure that her darling would
take cold because he was not at all strong. But Wilbur
carried his point. A half hour later, warmly
clad and well equipped for their day of sport they
set out, being soon joined by Dr. Arthurs, Norman
and Westcot, they formed quite a party of hunters.
As they started away from the Westcot home a pair
of dark eyes, watching them from the window of the
invalid, grew dim and a pair of lips quivered in helpless
longing. But fair woman’s hands took him in
tow and made it so pleasant and entertaining that he
forgot the manly sports the others were following.</p>

<p class='c005'>The hunters were out long hours. Up hills and
down valleys, through woods and meadows, across
rocks and frozen brooks they went. Warming to the
excitement of the sport, which sent the blood bounding
through his veins Homer forgot he was weak and
tired. The reaction set in, however, and when
they returned he slept long hours, but when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>evening came he was ready and anxious to go to the
home of the Westcots.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next morning another excursion had been
planned and again they carried Homer with them.
This time they managed to take Elmer also, in spite
of the protests of the anxious mother who saw certain
death in store for her pampered darlings—tramping
about these rough mornings through the snow;
and when she saw them return so tired they almost
fell asleep on their feet she felt more anxious than
ever. Soon, however, a change made itself manifest.
They were less fretful and discontented. Their eyes
were brighter, a more healthy color tinged their
cheeks, while they ate with an apparent appetite.</p>

<p class='c005'>Paul Arthurs now frequently called at the house.
He also prescribed a new course for the younger
children. He forbade sweetmeats, spices and condiments.
A simple diet of bread, milk and grain
foods, fruits and nuts, he told the mother, was far
more wholesome than the meats and highly seasoned
food they had hitherto been accustomed to.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Give them a daily bath, then rub them until a
warm glow shows itself; then plenty of outdoor exercise.
The cold will not hurt them, but rather benefit
them. Let them go coasting, skating and snowballing
until they are tired out, so tired that they scarce
can keep on their feet, and my word for it, Madame, if
you follow this course, you will soon have the satisfaction
of seeing the glow of health in the faces of your
children. They need no medicine. They are suffering
from a nervous debility that only exercise in the
open air and wholesome simple food will correct. I
look to you,” turning to Edith, “to see that these
directions are carried out. You understand, I am
sure?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Edith as well as Hilda did understand. The
young doctor as well as the girls did not dare to tell
Mrs. Wallace the true reason of the delicate state of
health of all her children—that the seeds thereof had
been sown in the abominable boarding schools she
would have considered highly improbable. At however
slight intimation of the real cause she would
have been liable, in her passion, to turn them all
from the house and thus her children would have
been robbed of the only chance of regaining their
health. So they wisely kept the secret they had
penetrated and insisted on a course of treatment that
these pampered darlings thought extremely cruel.
But soon the effect was apparent, and there was hope
that the morbid cravings might be destroyed, and a
strong and pure manhood and womanhood be secured
to them in the future.</p>

<p class='c005'>So it was that a new life entered this house, and
in a manner scarcely noticeable. A better footing
was established between the stepmother and the
daughters. There was more peace and quiet. Once
in a while the order was reversed and the circle would
gather in the Wallace home, but not often. There
were many reasons why it should not be the same.
The visitors were made welcome, it is true, but the
entertainers must at all times be guarded in their
speech. They could not be quite themselves; and
then Frank never gathered enough strength to bear
the fatigue of the drive back and forth in the cold
night air. One or the other would remain at home
with him, as in spite of his protests his sisters and
friends would not consent to leave him alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Wallace had tried hard to induce Wilbur to
take up his abode in his house during his stay in the
city, but in this the son was obdurate. He had buried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>and consigned to oblivion much of the past, for the
sake of his sisters and also for the sake of those other
children who were also his brothers and sisters, and
whom he would, as it were, snatch from an early
grave, but he could not bring himself to lay his head
on the pillow beneath the roof that should have been
a loving shelter to his own precious mother; in the
home of the man who should have loved and cherished
instead of driving her with his criminal neglect to a
watery grave. When such thoughts came to him it
was all he could do to curb the ill-will that would fill
his heart, and only by the force of his strong will did
he succeed in banishing a feeling of hatred.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile Wilbur became more dear day by
day, to the father, whose heart went out to the
children of his first marriage as it had never done to
the younger ones.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus the weeks passed away and Christmas was
drawing near when the mail brought a letter from
Margaret to her mother. A cry of joy broke from
her lips as she read its contents.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it?” cried the girls in chorus.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, listen! It is almost too good to be true!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now, dearest mamma, let me wind up this
epistle by a little bit of news. By some strange and
opportune circumstance we have no engagement for
two weeks, beginning with Christmas morning, and
now I mean for a short time to join that precious
circle of which I have heard so much. O, you don’t
know how impatient I am as the time draws near. I
am longing, am homesick for you all. It is sweet,
this thing called fame and homage, to be greeted and
rewarded with applause, but the heart-felt affection of
your loved ones is something different, and O, so
much more satisfying.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>This indeed was news and joy. Imelda knelt at
Mrs. Leland’s side, laying her head upon her motherly
knee,</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, I am so glad, so glad! for once our circle will
be complete.” Glancing up, her eyes met those of
Cora. The look of pain and silent reproach therein
pierced to her very heart. Hastily rising, with a
quick step she was at Cora’s side, winding her arms
about her she laid her face to hers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Forgive me, little sister. For a moment I forgot
that we cannot be complete until one more noble
man, your own Owen, shall have joined us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Cora smiled through her tears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is nothing to forgive, only sometimes I
grow so hungry, so heart hungry, so love hungry.
I know everyone here loves me, yet——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet the supreme love, the love of him who
makes life’s sunshine for you, is wanting; is not that
so? But why, little one, do you not send him the
word which will bring him to you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know; but I have the feeling that for
some reason it would be useless. I will wait a little
while longer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So a few more days went by and at last Christmas
morning dawned. A solitary watcher paced up
and down the platform in front of the depot awaiting
the arrival of the incoming train, his impatience not
permitting him to seek the warmth indoors as many
others were doing. Up and down, up and down, he
paced, the dark eyes glowing in their suppressed
eagerness when at last the whistle sounded on the
clear, crisp air and a few minutes later the thundering
train discharged its load of human freight, and
was again putting away on its eastern course. A tall,
fair-haired woman was seen casting searching glances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>about when a pair of arms were laid upon her shoulders.
She was gently turned about, almost at the
same moment a pair of moustached lips pressing hers,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Margaret, my rare, sweet Margaret!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wilbur!” Another kiss followed, then quickly
she was assisted to a seat in the waiting cutter, snugly
tucked in with warm robes and furs and in a few
minutes more they were speeding along over the
frozen snow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My mother, is she well? and Imelda, and Alice,
and her babies, and all the rest whom I have not seen,
are they all well and happy?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Wilbur laughed. “One question at a time if
you please, my girlie. But as to each and all I can
give the same answer, so will I answer them all at
once with the one little word ‘Yes,’ and they have
sent me along to greet you, not but one and all are
just as eager and impatient to greet and welcome my
darling. Only they have kindly conceded the privilege
to me to be the first to embrace my girlie, for
which I certainly am thankful. For when that bevy
of women once have you in their clutches—there now!
I retract that word, but it is certain when they have
secured you I may not hope to again speak to you in
a hurry. For some time at least they will own you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>By this time they were leaving the turmoil and
noise of the city in their rear and as the roads were
quiet and deserted, the arm of the young driver
gently stole about the slender waist of the woman at
his side. Nothing loath the fair head rested against
his shoulder while the blue eyes looked up into the
black ones with love unutterable. Again their lips
met in a clinging kiss.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O sweetheart and lover, it seems so good once
more to be able to nestle in your arms.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>To press her still more closely was his only answer.
Thus laughing and talking, loving and kissing,
they enjoyed to the utmost that drive in the crisp,
cold air, and soon they arrived at their destination,
where many open arms were extended to receive the
fair Margaret.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My darling!” and</p>

<p class='c005'>“My own mamma!” were the caressing words
exchanged as Mrs. Leland folded her daughter to her
heart. But not for long was she permitted to hold
her there. Imelda’s brown eyes were beaming with
love and pleasure. Alice was eager for a kiss, her
two pretty babies wanted to be noticed by this
new auntie. Then Imelda drew her aside where the
hazel-eyed Cora was standing with one arm laid lovingly
about the shoulders of a pale-faced young man.
Margaret needed no introduction. By letter she had
long since known of the finding of both of Imelda’s
wayward ones, and a single glance told her all. She
took the girl’s face between her hands and gently
kissed the cherry lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am so glad for your own as well as for
Imelda’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was her greeting and Cora understood, for
her eyes filled with tears. Frank’s hand she took
between both of hers and knelt at his side.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you are the brother I have so often heard
her speak about. For Imelda’s sake you must be my
brother also, as my own brother has been absent for
so long a time I can scarce remember him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Frank’s face became sad and his eyes misty.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, but your own brother is so much more
deserving than I. Would that my record were as
clean.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret shook her head.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>“Not so downcast and self-reproachful, my boy.
We are so much the creatures of circumstances we
cannot well help doing just the things we do. The
past you have done with, only the future is yours, to
make that what it should be will be your task, your
duty, your pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In his turn Frank shook his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No! no! even that boon will be denied me. My
bad deeds can’t be undone; to atone for them will not
be permitted me. My days, my hours, even, are
numbered. No, no, please don’t. I understand what
you would say. Why should such a truth-loving
woman as you seek to deceive me. I know it all, and
I suppose it is best so. Look, there at your mother’s
side another awaits to welcome you, one who is nearer
and dearer to you than such a poor wreck of humanity
as I could ever dare hope to be.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Following the direction indicated by Frank
Margaret saw, standing at her mother’s side, an arm
thrown caressingly about her shoulders, a young man
as yet almost a boy, fair sunny locks thrown carelessly
back from a broad and open brow, a look of
longing in the frank blue eyes, and suppressed emotion
quivering about the sensitive mouth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Slowly Margaret drew herself up to her full
height, with her eyes fastened on that boyish and yet
manly form. Was it—O was it——? Her mother’s
hand went up to his face and drew it close to her own,
holding it there, the other hand she extended to her
daughter. With bated breath Margaret crossed the
room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your brother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then both of Margaret’s hands were extended
and both were clasped firmly and tenderly, and,</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>“Osmond!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Margaret!”—spoken in a breath, and Margaret
knew that at last her mother had her heart’s one
desire; her boy, her baby is once more her own, and
the sister is clasped in her brother’s embrace.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, this is indeed a merry Christmas, and you
are the nicest Christmas gift I could have wished
for. But how is it, mamma, that you have not written
this to me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because I so sincerely hoped and believed that
you would make it possible to spend a week with us,
and I wanted to surprise you. Have I succeeded?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed you have, my darling mamma. But is
this boy always so tongue-tied, having just nothing
at all to say?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Osmond laughed,</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe you are a saucebox! But that isn’t a
bit nice of me, is it? to call you names in the first
moments of our acquaintance—with the first words
I address to you. I promise you to try and do better
and say something nice. I don’t believe you are
easily spoiled and feel that I may tell you, that already
I am proud of my sister. I think they have
named you well—Margaret. A daughter of the
Gods, divinely tall and most divinely fair——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For shame, Osmond; to try to pay your sister
compliments in such wornout phrases.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A laugh followed and the ice was broken.
Margaret felt and knew that she should love this
brother. As the days of the following week glided
by she gradually came to know all there was to tell
and to learn. Osmond told her all about the father
who opposed his coming here, when by accident he
discovered that it was the boy’s mother he daily went
to see; of the battle he had fought and how he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>come off conqueror; of how there had been much in
common between them; but that of late he was daily
drifting more and more away from his father; then of
how he had come into this circle, and how he had
gradually come to hear and then understand their
ideas; how he had come to know and understand
what true womanhood and manhood were, what they
meant, and that he now knew that his mother and
sister were sweet and pure and true, notwithstanding
the teachings of his father.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Margaret had come to know the sisters of
Wilbur, and knew not which was the most love-worthy,
the stately Edith or the sweet, gentle Hilda. She
saw the heightened color in the cheeks of the former
when the young physician was holding her attention;
she saw the sparkling light in the eyes of the latter
and the answering light in those of Lawrence Westcot;
the adoration in Imelda’s glance as it rested on
the splendid figure of Norman Carlton, whom indeed
she found to be all her friend had said of him. “One
of nature’s noblemen” was the best she knew how to
describe him. But to which, indeed, of the manly
faces and forms should she not have applied the same
appellation? And O, how she enjoyed the society of
this bright circle! how swiftly the hours and days
flew by. How soon she knew her short vacation
would be over and that again she must away to her
work.</p>

<p class='c005'>She loved her work but she could not help feeling
sad that her visit would be of such short duration.
She would nestle closer to Wilbur’s side, and
just a little more passion would creep into her kisses,
when she was folded against his heart, at the thought
of the coming separation.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the first week of her vacation neared its close,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>and all felt more than ever before the rapid flight of
time, when one evening Norman joined the circle
holding a telegram aloft.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look,” he said, “this announces the visit of a
friend of olden days, a college mate, a most precious
friend whom I will turn over to the tender mercies of
our ladies; a splendid fellow, wholesouled and true.
Maybe you girls can make another addition to our
circle. He is well worth the winning, though he
be a married man.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>We must now retrace our steps for some months
back to the golden summer time.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the great eastern metropolis, on the sunny
banks of the beautiful Hudson, almost hidden within
a grove of wild plum and cherry trees, stands a cosy
cottage. Snowy lace curtains drape the windows.
Creeping vines almost cover it like a heavy green
coverlet. On the shady porches are arranged a profusion
and variety of richly blooming plants. The
grass plots surrounding the house are dotted with
beds of rare flowers which fill the air with fragrance.</p>

<p class='c005'>But in spite of all the tempting beauty of the
place there was an air of desertion about it that one
felt rather than saw. The sultry summer day was
drawing to its close. Evening was casting its lengthening
shadows across the paths. Many of the beautiful
blossoms drooped their heads as if weary and
sad, while every window and door was closely fastened.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was not a single sign of life about the
place, when suddenly the click of the garden gate
was heard, and a man with hasty steps came walking
up the path. His face was pale and handsome, his
eyes blue, and his drooping, silky mustache a decided
red. The hair of the head, however, was of a darker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>hue, a handsome brown. He was admitted to the
house by an old negress, whose face wore an extremely
doleful expression.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello! Aunt Betty, what’s wrong? Your
young mistress is well, I hope?” But not waiting
for answer he pushed by her, and was half way up
the stairway when the old woman’s voice arrested his
footsteps.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No use, Massa Hunter. The young Missis is
not upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not upstairs! Then where is she, pray? Tell
me at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For answer the old woman covered her face with
her snowy apron and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the meaning of this?” the young man
demanded. “Has anything happened? Where is
Cora? Don’t you see how you are torturing me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know. Indeed I don’t! She just put
on her plainest dress and says to me: ‘I is going
away, aunty, you can keep dis as a present from me,’
and she gi’ me a purse all filled with gold. ‘You is
to remain here,’ she says, ‘until the massa comes and
den you gi’ him dis.’ Then she gi’ me lettah, and
dat is all I knows.”</p>

<p class='c005'>His face was ashy white and his hand shook as
with palsy as the negress handed him the missive
which he instinctively knew was a farewell from the
one woman who was dearer to him than life. A
deadly fear crept into his heart as he went into the
little parlor and closed the door as if to shut out the
glad sunlight while he read the words that had been
penned with a broken heart. Here and there a stain,
a tell-tale mark had been left by a falling tear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will forget,” she wrote, “that such a one
as I have ever crossed your path. It is better thus.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>It seems my destiny only to bring pain and suffering
to those who love me.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do not fear I may sink again to the level on
which you found me and from which you rescued
me. You have taught me a woman’s real worth and
no degrading action or word shall ever again soil my
life. I was reckless and daring to accept the priceless
boon of your love without first inquiring if you
were free to love. I did not know, O, I did not
know, that law and custom had already bound you to
another. I cannot permit you to make a criminal of
yourself, and when you return I will be gone. Don’t
seek to find me. What would be the use? The
world is wide and somewhere I shall be able to live
out this life which consists of so much more pain than
joy. I am young and strong, and shall find work
somewhere. Good bye! Farewell, my Owen, my
lover. Reserve in your memory one little spot of
green for your own unhappy.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

    </div>

</div>

<p class='c004'>The closely written sheets fluttered from his
hand and fell unheeded to the floor. His head sank
upon his arm where it fell upon the table. Thus he
sat long hours. The day had gone out in the gloaming.
The twilight hours passed and ushered in the
dark night and still he sat there. Then he arose and
dragged his weary footsteps to the pretty bed
chamber which was to know her no more. There,
where he had spent so many sweet and indescribably
happy hours, he threw himself upon the bed and
buried his face in the snowy pillows which her head
had so often pressed.</p>

<p class='c005'>At sunrise he left the sacred abode. He told the
old negress to remain and take care of the little home
just the same as if her mistress were there. Giving
her a well filled purse he turned his back upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>place where love had been wont to welcome him and
went straight to the mansion where dwelt the haughty
Leonie, his wife.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c005'>“I will never give in! Never! never! I would
scratch the eyes out of her white face first!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The shrill voice almost shrieked the words and
the black eyes of the angry woman flashed fire as the
white face twitched with fury which transformed
it until it became almost hideous.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I would murder the brazen hussy ere I would
——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not another word! I will not hear your vile
tongue defame her whose shoes you are not worthy
to wipe. Yon have driven my poor girl away. If
sin there be, it is mine. She never knew I had a
wife. She was content to give me her love until you
drove her forever out of my life. So on that score
you can rest easy, but I repeat that I will not continue
this farce any longer. I have crossed the
threshold of the dwelling that you call home for the
last time. I shall sever now and for all time every
tie that binds me to you. You can retain this house
if you wish it. I do not want it. I shall deposit a
million dollars at my banker’s to your credit. Then
you can apply for a divorce just as soon as you may
desire.”</p>

<p class='c005'>To be mistress of this lordly mansion was by
no means a small thing. When he made the declaration
that she was to retain it together with a princely
fortune, an iron band seemed to loosen from about
Leonie’s throat but she gave no sign of her intense
gratification.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just then the tinkling of a bell was heard in the
distance; a few moments later a servant appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>with a card. Before Leonie could step forward,
Owen had already secured the card and as the man
again noiselessly withdrew he cast a quick glance at
the name inscribed thereon,</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Wilson Porter!’ Your name, fair lady, has
lately often enough been coupled with this one, and
as Wilson Porter is neither a fool nor a knave, to the
best of my knowledge, I am sorry for him. He deserves
a better fate than to be drawn in by a woman
of the Leonie Hunter stamp. The immaculate
woman who could hurl such withering scorn on an
unfortunate sister really ought not to throw stones
as she herself is the inmate of a glass house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned and left her standing there, and as he
opened the door to pass out he lifted his hat to Wilson
Porter who had come to conduct Leonie to Mrs.
Van Gorden’s reception.</p>

<p class='c005'>For days and weeks Owen kept up an incessant
search for the missing girl but no trace could be
found of her whereabouts. His face became haggard,
his manner nervous and restless. Sleep fled his
eyes, and as summer gave way to autumn, followed
by dreary winter, the conviction slowly forced itself
upon the mind of the lonely and embittered man that
his dream of bliss had ended.</p>

<p class='c005'>Never in all this time had he seen Leonie. His
life with her had been a miserable failure and he
never wished to see the dark passionate face again.
And in reality Leonie cared very little for the doings
of her truant husband. Now as before she queened
it in society. As a matter of course it was accepted
that Wilson Porter on all occasions should be her
escort. The society world had become accustomed
to that fact; there was no longer anything new and
strange about it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>But if Leonie cared little, Owen cared still less,
and as on the clear frosty night of Christmas eve the
clanging of the merry bells were calling the orthodox
masses both rich and poor to commemorate the birthnight
of a world’s redeemer, he stood watching the
surging masses with a scornful smile curling the
finely chiseled lips, he murmured:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder how much Christian love and charity
has done to make the world better. Bah! nothing
but cupidity, sordid lust for gain, fill the hearts of
one class, whilst superstition, prejudice and ignorance
rule the other. The one class rivets the chains;
the other hugs them. O how beautiful the world
might be if poor groveling humanity would but be
natural. Of all things under the sun possessed of
life and motion the human family alone is taught it
is wrong to be natural, that it is right to outrage
nature’s laws, even though death be the penalty.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder if, in all New York to night, there is
one who is more wretchedly poor and desolate than I
am, with my millions? Of what use are they to me?
They cannot buy me happiness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The heart-sick man paced the streets until they
were wholly deserted. A restless spirit kept him on
the move until the bells of the Christmas morn
proclaimed “Peace upon earth, good will to men.”
Again the scornful smile curved his lips as he whispered:
“Where is it? O, where is this chanted
peace?</p>

<p class='c005'>As he was beginning to feel tired and was about
to return to his hotel his attention was attracted by
the movements of a man a short distance in advance
of him who was staggering along the street as if intoxicated.
Impelled by some strange fascination
Owen followed, never for a moment taking his eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>off the figure in advance. The reeling man soon
came to Riverside drive, and thence to the Park
which he entered and passed through the winding
paths down to the river’s edge. His movements became
more and more suspicious. Owen quickened
his steps almost to a run and just as he was on the
verge of taking the fatal leap he reached the side of
the stranger, and hastily grasping him by the arm he
quickly drew him back. The man reeled and almost
fell from the force of the impelling motion. When
he regained his equilibrium he turned his white and
stern face upon Owen who dared to interfere with
his actions.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let go my arm,” came in a husky gasp from
his lips. “By what right do you compel me to remain
where there is nothing but pain and sorrow,
where all is cruel deceit, blackness and lies, while
down there in the clear depths peace and rest await
me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen retained his grasp while he looked the
other full in the face. He saw it clearly now. The
man was not intoxicated; he was sick. The eyes
glowed feverishly from their hollow sockets, his
cheeks were sunken, what were to be seen of them,
for the lower part of his face was covered with a
handsome flowing beard.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are sick,” said Owen, “and are raving.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sick? Yes! Raving? Ha! ha! ha!” The
wild weird laughter made Owen think he was confronting
a madman. “So would you rave were the
bloodhounds of the law hunting, dogging your every
step.” Another chill crept over Owen. Was it a
desperate criminal he had encountered? Had he
made a mistake in attempting to interfere with the
action of this stranger? Then again, when he looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>closer, he did not believe it. By the bright light of
the full moon the face before him showed not a
single trace of what he would expect to find in the
face of a criminal. Sick and delirious he might be,
but nothing else. Speaking in an authoritative manner
he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come with me. This is no place for you. I
will see that you are taken home and cared for.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Home! Ha! ha! What a mockery the word
is. I wonder if any one ever has known by experience
what the word implies?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen was beginning to feel the effects of the cold.
Here by the water’s edge it was doubly keen and the
standing still added still more to it. Once more he
spoke. “Come, you can not stand here all night,
and surely you have thought better of the rash action
you contemplated. At any rate I shall not move
from your side until you come with me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A bitter smile for a moment rested upon the
bearded face of the stranger, then he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, some other time will do as well.
Lead. I will follow, and then explain why on this
night of all others, when the world is rejoicing over
the birth of a redeemer I came so near seeking and
finding a watery grave.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen accompanied the staggering stranger to
Seventh avenue where they had the good fortune to
find a cab. Both men got in and were driven rapidly
to the hotel where Owen was staying, arriving there
just as the gray dawn was breaking. Having reached
Owen’s rooms the stranger sank exhausted into a
cushioned chair. Owen assisted him to disrobe and
placed him on the couch where he was soon sleeping
soundly, then stretched his tired limbs upon a lounge
and in a little while he also was in the land of dreams.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>It was almost noon when Owen awoke. He
arose and walked over to the bed whereon the
stranger was still sleeping. While debating the advisability
of awakening the man before him the
stranger opened his eyes. A bewildered look for a
moment filled them, then returning memory brought
with it recognition of the face before him and the
circumstances which brought him into the present
surroundings. A bitter smile moved the bearded
lips as he half rose. Leaning his head upon his hand
he let his gaze wander about the luxurious apartment;
biting scorn was in his words as he spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is not likely that you, who can afford surroundings
like these, would ever attempt so desperate
a deed as you prevented me from doing a few hours
ago.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why did you do it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why did I do it? You cannot realize to what
utter despair and darkness you have called me back.
I will have all these battles to fight over again, and
the struggle is not an easy one, I can assure you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The bitterness that rang through every word betokened
a despair that was deep seated, and Owen’s
heart was touched deeply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell me, and let me judge. But first, however,
I think it would be advisable to take care of the
inner man. So while you arrange your toilet, I will
order some breakfast. It is somewhat late in the
day for that meal and all the more necessary that it
should be partaken of.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Accordingly a generous repast was ordered
which was served in an adjoining apartment. After
they had finished their meal they drew their chairs
before the fire. The stranger leaned his head with its
heavy clustering hair upon one hand and sat staring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>into the glowing coals. Owen did not disturb his
train of thought but patiently awaited his pleasure,
and by and by he was rewarded. The hand dropped
and the head was raised.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now, since you have shown an interest in
my case, I shall tell you my story briefly. For years
I have been the only support of a widowed mother,
an only sister and a delicate younger brother. My
father has been dead quite a number of years and sad
as is the fact, it was rather a relief to be rid of him.
The more pitiful because of the fact that he was a
very intellectual man once, but hard luck during the
early years of his married life, when it seemed that
there was no work for him to do even though he
offered his service for a mere pittance, had embittered
him. He had loved the girl he married and
bright were his visions of the future. But his misfortune
made him desperate and he took to drink,
which transformed the gentle-tempered, loving man
into a veritable demon. Forgetting that unkind fate
had already placed a much too heavy burden upon
the slender shoulders of the delicate woman the
demon of jealousy took possession of him. Discord
dwelt where love and tenderness once held supreme
sway.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only when at great intervals he let drink alone
long enough to clear his befuddled brain, would the
intelligent mind assert itself. But the realization of
his wretched condition and surroundings would then
drive him almost distracted and he would return to
his cups with a wilder abandon than ever. When
in a drunken brawl he was struck down and they
brought the livid corpse to the wretched abode he
had called home, the unhappy family were conscious
of a feeling of relief rather than that of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>“I was then but fourteen years old, but tall for
my age and on me fell the task of supporting my
mother and younger brother and sister. It was little,
indeed, that a lad of my age could earn; but we fared
better than hitherto. And as I grew older and was
able to earn more our condition improved.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As my education had been sadly neglected in
my childhood and I began to realize it, I determined
yet to master it, so my evenings were now devoted to
study. My sister, a very pretty and charming girl,
when she became old enough also added her mite by
becoming a factory girl. Her beauty made her position
a difficult one, and her warm love nature, which
had been starved into a craving hunger, caused her
to fall an easy prey to the handsome, wealthy young
scoundrel who was the son of the factory owner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Her condition soon became apparent and when
I questioned her she broke down and confessed the
whole pitiful story. She had not even the tender
words and caresses of her lover, now, to support
her. He had tired of his plaything and cast her
aside. I understood what arts are employed to lure
to her destruction a poor loving creature and could
only pity her from the bottom of my heart. Not so,
however, my mother. She had been reared within
the narrow confines of the church. Her standard of
virtue was, ‘touch me not,’ regardless of what the
circumstances might have been. So the mother who
should have been her stay and comfort only cast reproaches
upon the head of the despairing girl, driving
her almost insane. My brother, too, would not
forgive her for the disgrace she had brought upon
him. He would not speak to her. I have often seen
him draw back at her approach that her clothing
might not brush against him.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>“Of course he was very young then, only a boy,
not yet fifteen, but it would cut me to the heart to
see the blood mount to her face. When it became
unbearable she would fly to me and I would try all
in my power to pacify her; drawing upon myself the
condemnation of the others, who could not understand
how I could countenance such shamelessness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But even my sympathy could not sustain the
breaking heart, and when the trying hour came her
strength failed, and with a little stillborn girl-baby
folded in her arms my beautiful sister was laid out of
sight.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Although my mother wept bitter tears, I fear
she felt much relieved that the matter ended as it did,
for now grass would grow over the grave of Millie’s
shame. Robert, my brother, also seemed deeply
affected. But her name was never mentioned now.
I knew best what the poor girl had suffered, and it
was a long time ere I could forgive either my mother
or my brother. Robert was not very sweet-tempered
at best. From his birth he had been delicate. A
puny, fretful infant, he came at a time when the
nightly debauches of my father set my mother almost
wild, souring an otherwise gentle and loving nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Notwithstanding his ailings, however, he was
his mother’s favorite. Though his advent had been
dreaded, upon his arrival her heart went out to him
with a spasmodic passion. She never refused him
anything it was in her power to give, thereby showing
a decided weakness of character.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This was the worst thing she could have done,
as it had the tendency to develop all the bad traits of
Robert’s weak character. As he was physically unfit
for work the support of the family rested entirely
upon my shoulders. But as the years sped by there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>came a change. A saucy black-eyed maiden crossed
my path and my fate was sealed. I loved her with
all the strength of my passionate nature. To me
she seemed perfect and I had no greater desire than
to make her my wife. First, however, I felt it my
duty to tell her of the sad history of my early life.
She gave the black curls a saucy toss and said she
could not see how all this should possibly effect us
any. I caught her in my arms and strained her to
my breast, my heart filled with admiration of the
grand nobility of character, which I thought was exhibited
in those words; never once dreaming that it
was her very lack of character which prompted that
declaration.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“In a short time we were married. But my
dream of happiness was short lived. My wife and
my mother had little in common, and often the passionate
red lips would utter words that wounded the
elder woman to the very heart. I soon saw how
matters stood but was unable to control them. I
pleaded with Annie, I reasoned with my mother; but
the two beings whom I loved better than any others
in the world had no love for each other. Several
times I spoke sharply to Annie and to my surprise
Robert sided with my wife against me and the mother
who worshiped him. This seemed to break her heart
and it was not long until she closed her eyes in her
last long sleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>“When all was over I again sought to reason
with my wife. I folded her to my heart whilst I
could scarcely repress the sobs that would well up
from its depths. It seemed to me that she at first
shrank from me, but I thought it must be only
imagination.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She now often treated me to perfect storms of
passionate caresses and I was as wax in her band.
No request could I deny her, and I found myself
rapidly sinking in debt. But I should not blame her.
Poor child! she knew no better. She had been left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>an orphan at an early age; cuffed about from place to
place, her heart always full of longings which were
never satisfied. When she married me she believed
all that would be at an end. What one man could
do for his wife another should also do for his. That
this was impossible she could not understand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sometimes I felt like cursing her, then overwhelmed
by a rush of tenderness I would almost
crush her in my embrace and again she would win
the victory. But the time came when I felt the
waves closing over my head, and I surely must have
been mad or I would never have done what I did.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The voice of the man broke and a suspicious
moisture could be seen in his eyes. For a moment,
he laid his hand over them ere he proceeded:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I robbed my employer’s safe of ten thousand
dollars. I knew I would be received with a storm of
kisses and caresses which would outweigh everything
else. Let come what would, for once she should be
perfectly happy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“With the stolen treasure in my pocket I hurried
home, a full hour earlier than usual, in a state
of delirious excitement bordering upon insanity. I
found the door locked, but having my latch key with
me I did not ring but quietly let myself in.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The little parlor was deserted; so was the dining room
and kitchen. The soft carpet deadened the
sound of my footsteps. I went from room to room
and in Robert’s room I heard voices. The door stood
slightly ajar. Touching it lightly it opened several
inches wider and the sight that met my eyes broke
my heart. Clasped close in each other’s arms; their
heads pressing the same pillow, were Robert and my
wife. A quick movement opened the door wide with
a creaking sound; the two heard and both started up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>as if electrified. Annie screamed and clapped both
hands to her face. Robert’s face was a study. Hate
and defiance were written in every line of it. With
a sudden movement he took a revolver from his
pocket and leveled it at my heart. But quick as was
his action I forestalled him. With a single bound I
gave his arm an upward blow sending the bullet into
the ceiling and the revolver to the far end of the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Madman!’ I cried. ‘What would you do?
Have you not enough upon your conscience that you
would commit murder?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“The sullen, defiant look upon his face deepened.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘I hate you!’ he almost hissed. ‘You are a
constant bar to my happiness.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Unjust as I knew this accusation to be I made
no comment upon it but asked:</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Tell me one thing, and without prevarication.
Do you love Annie?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quick as a flash came the answer,</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘I do!’</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘And you, Annie, do you love Robert?’</p>

<p class='c005'>“But Annie sobbed and would not give an intelligible
answer, until I sternly repeated the question,
and then, between broken sobs:</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘O, I cannot help it. Indeed, indeed I cannot
help it.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Staggering as beneath a blow I steadied myself
for a moment against the table, then, with a mighty
effort of will recovering myself, I took the stolen
money from my pocket and threw it on the table.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Take it,’ I said, ‘and make the most of it. I
have now no use for it. Be happy if you can, I shall
no longer stand in the way. You are free in every
sense of the word to do as you choose.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“I turned to leave the room when Annie threw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>herself sobbing in my way. She clung to me in
passion and despair, asserting again and again that
she ‘could not help it.’ Almost forcibly I loosened
her hold and pointing to the money on the table I
said to Robert,</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘See to it, that you handle the money wisely,
and remember that this girl now depends upon you
for the comfort, of life. I have done with both of
you!’</p>

<p class='c005'>“Overcome by a sudden impulse I once more
caught her in my arms, clasping her close to my
breast. I pressed a last kiss upon her lips, then
putting the half-fainting form from me I rushed
out into the cold night air. I surely need say no
more. You now can understand what drove me to
the verge of desperation. To find the woman who
had driven me to the verge of ruin, untrue, was more
than I could bear. A day or two and I would stand
before the world exposed. The shame, the disgrace
and the walls of Sing Sing loomed up before my
mind’s eye. I had been a slave all my life to adverse
conditions. And now to lose the one boon that I
prized above all others—my liberty! No, I would
die first! And yet I had it not in my heart to wish
any ill to those two. True, I felt bitter towards
my brother, but for some reason the fact of his
actual helplessness was more clear in my mind than
ever before. Have there not been countless cases
wherein this very defect has appealed to the hearts
of strong, healthy women?—and her pitiful ‘I cannot
help it’ kept ringing in my ears. I knew I never
loved her more dearly than in the moment I gave her
up, or ever felt more tenderly towards him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Many conflicting thoughts surged through my
brain; while constantly I questioned, ‘Why? why?’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>And you may think me mad, sir, but the more I
thought the more I blamed not them, the chief actors
in this life tragedy, but the system from which such
abnormal conditions could arise, and in one day make
criminals of us all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen listened as if entranced. The excited man
had arisen and was pacing the room with hurried
strides, wildly tossing the masses of dark curling
locks. After a few moments he continued:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Often and often I had gnashed my teeth in
helpless fury when the few paltry dollars were laid
in my hands that constituted the remuneration for
work which I knew was worth more than fourfold
that which I received. I knew if justice could be
done I had only taken my own. But that was not
law.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now my mind wandered in another direction.
I knew Annie and Robert had been thrown long hours
together in my absence. His weak, delicate condition
first awoke her sympathy, and ‘pity is akin to
love.’ The frequent squabbling during the life time
of my mother helped develop these feelings in her
heart. So the weakling, who all his life had been
scorned and shunned by health-and-strength-loving
maidens, suddenly found himself the object of tender
and sympathetic glances, and what wonder that his
starved heart became inflamed? I could see the
whole proceeding was but natural. But oh, the
shame of it. No one else in all New York would look
at the matter as I did, when it became known. But
then the thought struck me, ‘Was it necessary?’ and
must I fill a convict’s cell? I answered: ‘No! No!
No! Never!’ Thus for many hours I walked the
streets, thinking, thinking, thinking, until I found
myself at the water’s edge about to end all the maddening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>perplexities, when your hand stayed my movements.
So now you are in possession of facts which
I had expected to take with me into my watery
grave.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The strange recital was at an end. Wearily the
narrator flung himself into his chair and leaned back,
white and exhausted. The bitter but musical voice
was hushed while Owen Hunter sat with his head
resting on his hand, lost in thought. Was the life of
every good man a wreck? For that the man who sat
before him was a good man he had not a single doubt.
Aside from the bitter experience of his own life he
had never thought of the struggling, suffering masses
of humanity. Ten thousand dollars! He had no
doubt that the sum seemed an enormous fortune to
the man before him, while to Owen it seemed scarce
worth mentioning.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What salary,” he asked, “did you receive?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A bitter smile curved the lips of the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fifty dollars per month.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Fifty dollars! How often had Owen thoughtlessly
squandered as much and more in a single evening;
and here was a man who with his family had to live
a whole month on it. For the first time in his life
the question arose why it was that those who were
the producers of all wealth should have so little of it
to enjoy; for the first time he asked himself. “Have
you a right to control so much money, while so many
others are suffering for the actual necessaries of
life?” What had he ever done to alleviate human
suffering? In memory he saw large figures heading
long lists of charity. “Charity!” Suddenly the
word seemed to him the most cold and heartless in the
English language. To offer charity where justice
was due! In that instant he resolved that the sons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>and daughters of humanity, the many poverty
stricken little children, should reap the benefit of the
money he controlled. He did not yet see his way
clear, and for the moment very wisely left the selection
of methods to the future. The present hour
belonged to the deeply stricken man who had permitted
him to read the pages of his sad history.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you not tell me your name?” he sympathetically
inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My name?” With indescribable bitterness he
spoke the words. “Why should I not give it you?
All New York will be ringing with it in a few days
when it will be known that the assistant bookkeeper
of the firm of Hunter &amp; Co. has proven false to his
trust. My name is Milton Nesbit!”</p>

<p class='c005'>As if electrified Owen turned upon the man before
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Repeat the name of the firm by which you
were employed!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hunter &amp; Co.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With a gasping sound Owen sank back, pale to
the very lips. Surprised, Milton Nesbit turned inquiringly
to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, what is wrong; are you ill?</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen shook his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No! no! It is not that, but——Well, why
should I search for empty words? My name is
Owen Hunter!”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was now Milton Nesbit’s turn to gasp with
surprise. He had been holding his position some
two years and in all that time had never seen the
senior member of the firm. He had been told it had
not always been thus; but for several years Owen
Hunter no longer took an active part in the business,
and most of the newcomers had never seen the man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>for whom they were coining and piling up money.</p>

<p class='c005'>Milton Nesbit felt a strange thrill as his eyes
rested upon the man who was to be his judge. An
unspeakable bitterness vibrated through his voice
when he again spoke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you are the Owen Hunter of Hunter &amp; Co.
and if I were a good Christian I should say that the
workings of an Almighty God could be traced in the
events of this most fateful day; that he so willed it
that it must be just the man whom I have robbed
whose hand should stay the act which would have
freed me from an accursed fate. But this just God
who is said to be all love will not have it so. Earthly
justice must first be satisfied; the almighty wrath
must first be appeased by giving man a chance to
avenge himself upon his fellow man. I simply call
it cruel, relentless fate, which has pursued me so
many years and which dates from the earliest recollections
of my childhood. Very well! pass the
sentence which I know lies in your power to enforce,
for ‘money rules the world,’ you know. Hand me
over to the guardians of the peace and let the law
take its course. It matters little what becomes of
me now. I may as well sleep behind prison bars as
anywhere else. The sunshine of happiness has long
since forsaken me; lost in the gloom and darkness of
despair.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Oh, the bitterness, the hopeless misery in the
strong man’s voice. He had risen and walked back
and forth the full length of the room, then with his
elbow resting upon the mantel, his hand supporting
his head, he stood glaring into the glowing coals,
awaiting his sentence. But Owen now no longer
calmly sat enjoying the comforts of the room. As
the other ceased speaking he stepped to his side and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>gently laying his hand upon his shoulder, said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you look me in the face?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Silently Nesbit turned and faced Owen. For
some minutes they stood thus face to face; then
Owen’s hand was extended.</p>

<p class='c005'>“May I ask you to give me your hand in friendship?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Surprise was depicted upon Nesbit’s face as he
looked at the outstretched palm, and then inquiringly
into the face of the man to whom it belonged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Friendship?” echoed Milton Nesbit, while he
nervously passed his hand over his forehead as if he
would dispel the mists which seemed to him to be
gathering there.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And why not? Am I selfish when I ask it?
But with my millions a true friend is something
which I have not, and now I am waiting to feel the
clasp of genuine friendship. Do I ask in vain?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Milton Nesbit’s face was a study. Queer little
quivers were stirring the muscles. Sinking once
more into his chair he buried his face in both hands.
For some time neither spoke, then the deeply moved
man raised his head and looked the other searchingly
in the eye.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And how about the criminal?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you feel yourself one?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The flash in the dark eye answered him even before
the firmly spoken words:</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I do not!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then once more I extend my hand and ask,
will you be my friend and brother? I might be able
to give you an insight into a life that would verify the
words, ‘All is not gold that glitters.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was now no hesitation, and in that handclasp
a life-long friendship was sealed. A Christmas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>morn it was to these two, that all their lives stood
out clear and bright.</p>

<p class='c005'>All that afternoon the two men sat in that quiet
comfortable room, and as Owen had first listened to
one of the saddest of life histories, so now, in turn,
he opened his heart to his new friend, and in the first
hour of his new-found friendship he proved it no idle
phrase, for in this hour he claimed Nesbit’s trust and
full confidence. If Milton could not at first give his
sanction to an affair like that of Owen, who having
already a wife, however unworthy, could take to his
heart another woman, and finding her as he had found
her, should hold her above all other women—this certainly,
should excite no surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>Remembering the woman who, though false to
him, he still loved, Milton could not sit in judgment
and condemn this other woman who had given the
wealth of her love to Owen without first asking leave
of some third person or persons. Just at present he
could see nothing clearly. He could feel, but was in
no condition to reason. Owen saw and understood,
and knowing that in his present condition the
best thing for Milton was change—change of scene
and of mental occupation, he at once decided to put
into execution a long-deferred plan of his own. He
would travel; he would take Nesbit with him as traveling
companion; and just then he remembered an old
college mate whom he had not seen for many years.
Why not begin the proposed journey by making a
call upon the friend of his youth?</p>

<p class='c005'>Accordingly a dispatch was at once sent to announce
their coming and in a very few days the two
friends, who had become such in a way so strange
and unexpected, were comfortably seated in a luxurious
Pullman car en route for the west.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>And thus it is that the threads of our story once
more unite. Again the figure of a man is pacing up
and down the platform, awaiting the incoming train
and, at last it comes thundering in and makes a brief
halt, Norman’s eyes rest upon the stalwart, manly
figure of the companion of his earlier days, and the
clasp of the hand that follows is almost painful. But
even in that first quick meeting, when joy lights up
the eyes of both, Norman sees the change in his old-time
friend; sees the lines that the flight of years
alone has not engraven on the handsome face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it Owen? There is that in your face
which tells me all is not well. Have you been sick?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Heart-sick—yes! to the extent that life sometimes
seems but a burden?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why should a man of almost unlimited wealth,
such as you possess, speak in such a strain?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, indeed! You speak as though wealth
could buy happiness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And can it not? Do you not know what untold,
what inconceivable misery could be turned to joy
with the assistance of wealth?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In thousands of cases, yes. In my own instance,
no! Wealth cannot heal a breaking heart,
cannot buy the happiness which has fled.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>“I believe I possess a panacea for an evil such as
yours. The society of sweet women will restore you
to life and love.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t speak of woman and love to me. I have
done with em!” Norman smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, I have touched the right cord, have I?
But that is a bold assertion which you have just made—that
you have done with women forever. Yet I
assert that you must—you must and you will be won.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t you know that I am a married man?”</p>

<p class='c005'>For a moment Norman looked him searchingly
in the face; then, as if satisfied, replied,</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what if you are? Are you sure that that
fact should prove a barrier to future happiness?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen Hunter in turn now looked Norman searchingly
in the face—</p>

<p class='c005'>“How am I to understand you? That the Norman
I once knew, and who I know possessed such
high-strung ideas of honor, should express himself
thus?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A slight flush rose to Norman’s brow. Hastily
he opened his lips to answer but as quickly checked
himself——</p>

<p class='c005'>“No more, now! This is scarce a proper place
to discuss the sort of topics we are drifting into.
Without doubt ere we part there will be moments
more opportune for thorough discussion. At present
I am eager to introduce you into a most charmed and
charming circle.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen shook his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have come to you for quiet, Norman. My
heart is sore, and needs rest. I would rather not
meet strangers. Besides I have with me a friend
whom I wish to introduce to you; also to ask your
forbearance for thus imposing on your hospitality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>as that is what I am about to do. Another storm-tossed
soul in need of rest and quiet; one who has
drained the bitter-cup of sorrow to its very dregs.”
Turning he approached a man who had hitherto stood
motionless at some little distance. A man well worth
looking at. Tall, well proportioned; dark, heavy
beard and clustering hair; with an unspeakable sadness
in the deep, gray eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I claim your hospitality for Milton Nesbit, as
well as for myself, and promise that neither shall be
too great a burden on your kindness, if you can secure
us the welcome of your mother and sisters. I
know it is much I ask of you, as our intimacy in the
past years can scarcely be called by the name of
friendship—but permit me, Mr. Nesbit, this is the
friend of my college days, Norman Carlton, of whom
I have been telling you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Extending his hand and firmly grasping that of
the stranger, Norman said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Permit me to welcome any friend that Owen
Hunter may introduce. You are worthy, or he
would not ask it: As for our friendship in the past,
if we have not been intimate friends it has not been
for lack of mutual attraction but rather that the ties
that bound us were not close enough, and it is not too
late to make them closer. I always felt the most
profound admiration for the sunny tempered youth I
knew as Owen Hunter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, for your generous welcome,” replied
a grave, musical voice. “I am but as an instrument
in the hands of Mr. Hunter. I follow
where he leads. Later I hope you will bid me welcome
on my own account.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Spoken like a man. I feel that already I may
speak the words of welcome in your own behalf.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>But come, dinner will be waiting, and in a well regulated
household, as you both understand, to the good
housewife that is abomination, and my mother knows
what good housekeeping is. But set your mind at
rest; she will tender you the welcome I ask for my
friends. Formal and precise she may be, but she is
also a most gracious hostess. My sisters also you
will find pleased to meet you. But they do not belong
to the charmed circle to which I insist on introducing
you. No protests! I will have my way.
You are already announced, and in this instance I
mean to be firm. You would scarcely be a man if
our many charmers cannot succeed in dispelling the
clouds, and a man must be of flinty hardness who
could listen to our song-bird, sweet, winsome Cora,
without being moved.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen started.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cora! did you say?—Cora? But pshaw! why
should I excite myself over a name. There are
hundreds of Coras in the world. But lead on. We
are ready to follow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So they piled into the cutter and as they dashed
over the snow quite forgot their sorrows, and as
events of their college years were gone over they
soon felt better acquainted than they had ever felt
in the olden days. But Milton Nesbit was quiet, very
quiet. He only spoke when spoken to, and Owen
now realized that it would be better for him to
mingle more with others in order to awaken again in
that crushed and bleeding heart an interest in life—to
deaden the pain that was ever gnawing at his vitals,
and though at first Nesbit refused to join the two
friends when evening drew near, preferring to remain
at home, and although Owen, too, would have
much preferred to remain in the seclusion of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>room, he feared to hurt the feelings of his kind host,
and therefore sacrificed his own desire to that of
Norman’s. As for Milton, Owen believed it absolutely
necessary that he should accompany them, and
insisted on his doing so.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unwilling to seem boorish, with a sigh Nesbit
prepared to make a martyr of himself. So when
Norman’s cutter drew up to the Westcot mansion he
brought two guests instead of the one expected, but
both were made equally welcome. For some reason
Norman had not mentioned the name of his intended
guest. No intentional oversight, I ween. He had
never heard the name of Cora’s lover and therefore
could not have known the link binding these two, so
when the name of Owen Hunter was announced, each
of the girls started. Owen must have thought, for
an instant, that they acted strangely, but quickly recovering
themselves they extended a hearty welcome.
Soft white hands were clasped in the manly ones;
rosy lips were wreathed in sweetest smiles. But as
Norman’s eyes went about the room he missed Cora,
and he asked Imelda where her sister was.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe she was telling baby Norma a story
and when that was finished Meta wanted a song, so
when she gets through entertaining the little folks
she will no doubt make her appearance,” she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen again started—upon being presented to
Imelda Ellwood, and the two names kept forming
themselves into one. “Cora, Ellwood; Cora, Ellwood!”
Surely he must be going mad. It was only
a coincidence, thought he. To find his own sweet
girlie here would be too good to be true. So he
devoted himself to Imelda and found himself admiring
the intelligent, gravely sweet girl who was so well
informed on whatever subject might be broached.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Milton Nesbit had been passed round, so to
say, from one fair maid to another, and all were
struck with the sad beauty of his manly face, but
unable to elicit many words from him, as his thoughts
were many miles away with the fair woman he had
left behind him. But now it was Alice who was talking
to him. That incessant little chatterbox did not
give him much time to talk or to think, even if he
had been so inclined,—she had so much herself to
say. It was said in a way so quaint and sweet, and
as she was mistress of the house and a married woman
he felt himself more at ease and more free in
her society, and ere long she managed to hold his
attention, and soon he found himself admiring the
dainty color in her cheeks, the pearly teeth gleaming
from between rosy lips, the mischief sparkling in
the clear blue eye, while her voice sounded like
tinkling music. The large room was pretty well
filled with ladies and gentlemen, but as she pointed
each one out to him it was with a word of praise and
love for some peculiar trait, attraction or accomplishment.
Not one disparaging word, and as his eyes
followed her indications he thought he had never
found so much harmony.</p>

<p class='c005'>While his eyes were roving from one to another
they rested on Cora who had but just entered the
room. Was it that he had not seen her before, or
was it that she possessed some feature more attractive
than the others? His eyes followed her every
movement as she gracefully found her way to the
piano and seating herself thereat began a prelude,
and soon the rich, full voice filled the room with its
rare music, while the sweet tones slightly trembled
as the words dropped from her lips:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Across the sobbing sea of doom</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>The weary world is slowly drifting.</div>
      <div class='line'>Eyes wet with tears peer through the gloom,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet see no sign of rest or rifting.</div>
      <div class='line'>Still angels bright from some far height,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Repeat through hoots of weary waking—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Hope’s starlight shines through darkest night,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To keep the world’s great heart from breaking!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Listening to the words they all knew there was
an undercurrent of meaning attached to the simple
strain that a stranger would not be apt to detect.
And yet Milton Nesbit understood, as well as if the
story had been told him in so many words, that the
gifted singer had known sorrow, and slowly his gaze
sought Owen Hunter. What was it? Owen had
risen from Imelda’s side, evidently unconscious that
he was acting strangely, that he was, to say the least,
impolite. He had neither eyes nor ears for anything
else but the fair singer. As if fascinated the song
drew him to her side. He repeated the words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hope’s starlight shines through darkest night”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>whispering them close to the pink shell ear,</p>

<p class='c005'>“O Cora, my own, is not the night over? May
the morning now at last dawn?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Quick as a flash Cora whirled about on her stool,
and with the one glad cry, “Owen!” cast herself
into his arms, regardless of the many eyes resting
upon them, and was held by him in an embrace so
close as if he meant never again to let her go.</p>

<p class='c005'>As if in that one glad happy cry all her strength
had been spent Cora lay back faint and white in her
anxious lover’s arms. Had the sudden joy killed
her? He strained her close and kissed the white
cold lips; then bearing her to a couch he began
chafing her hands, helplessly looking about,</p>

<p class='c005'>“She has fainted; can no one help me restore
her?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>Quickly an anxious circle gathered about her,
but Paul Arthurs soon reassured them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is nothing—only the reaction. She will be
herself in a few moments.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Taking a small vial from an inside pocket of his
coat he forced a few drops between her lips and in a
few moments had the satisfaction of seeing her open
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take her away where she can have rest and
quiet for half an hour; then she will be quite herself
again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Winding her arm about her, Imelda was about to
conduct her away when Owen laid his hand detainingly
upon her arm,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you not permit me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was so much pleading in the manly voice
and clear blue eyes that Imelda could not refuse him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will take good care of her?” with a smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will I?—as of my life! May I, Cora?”</p>

<p class='c005'>For answer Cora quietly laid her head against
his shoulder, smiling into his eyes, and thus he led
her from the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>What if instead of the half hour they remained
two long hours? and what if they thought it such a
very little while and that they had not had a chance
to say anything at all? Who would blame them?
Doubtless it was true that they had said very little.
Their hearts were too full to speak: too full of unutterable
love and happiness, and certainly none in
that room thought of blaming them. And when they
returned Imelda and Norman were the first to greet
them. Cora’s arms wound themselves about her
sister’s neck while the men clasped hands with an undercurrent
of feeling such as they had not felt before,</p>

<p class='c005'>“So this is your charmed circle?” asked Owen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>Hunter in a husky voice, and smilingly Norman made
answer:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t you find it so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a suspicious moisture in Owen’s eyes
and his voice visibly trembled when he again asked,</p>

<p class='c005'>“And no censure meets us here?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why should there be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>But the man of the world could not understand.
His friend knew that he had left a wife, that his love
for this girl was an illicit one; yet here he stood
clasping his hand in a manner that seemed to indicate
to the fortune-tossed Owen that Norman was proud
to do so. So he drew him aside and asked the meaning
of it all.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nothing loath, Norman devoted himself for the
next half hour to answering his eager queries, seeking
to initiate him into the sweet love-laden theories
of the new doctrine to which he himself only a few
months ago had been a perfect stranger. Leaning
against a pillar Owen stood half hidden in an alcove,
lost in amaze and wonder; his eyes following every
movement of the girl he so madly worshiped.</p>

<p class='c005'>But still another was watching and waiting for
a solution of this mystery. Milton’s sad gray eyes
saw the happiness of his friend; had seen him catch
the fainting figure in his arms; had seen him press
his face against hers and kiss the white lips. He
could only guess that in some unlooked-for manner
he had found the woman for whom he had so long
been vainly seeking, and in the excitement which
followed he for a time was overlooked and forgotten.
But soon the merry peals of laughter, sweet music
and soft strains of song again filled the room, and
then, at the urgent request of Wilbur, Margaret read
some strong dramatic scenes from various plays,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>holding her listeners spellbound with the purity of
her voice, the strength and clearness of the rendition
and the depth of feeling which she exhibited. So, as
the evening passed, Milton Nesbit became more and
more puzzled as to what it was that made this circle
so charming—so delightfully entertaining that all his
perplexities were for the time forgotten and that
caused his sorrows to be dispelled as mist in the sunshine,
and his heart to grow warm once more.</p>

<p class='c005'>As he was one of the handsomest of the finely
formed men in the room it did not take long for
feminine eyes to detect that fact. Many were the
admiring glances bestowed upon him. But there
was something in the sad face which forbade intruding.
Only Alice—airy, fairy Alice, was not backward.
She again sought his side, showing him
books, etchings, engravings, and albums filled with
selections of art gems. Her sweet, airy manner, the
soft tender voice, acted like a charm upon his overwrought
nerves, and he soon found himself thoroughly
enjoying her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lawrence, Wilbur, the young physician and the
Wallace sisters had formed a little circle and were
discussing economics. Imelda was devoting herself
to her brother; making the evening pleasant for him;
answering his questions as to the meaning of Cora’s
strange demeanor in connection with this handsome
and refined looking stranger. Frank had already
learned much, was learning every day, but all was
not quite clear to him yet as to what it was that
made these pure-minded women and men so different
from others he had met and known in his reckless
and checkered life. She told him that it was a lover
of their sweet and lovable Cora, who, like himself,
had once been reckless and wayward. Margaret, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>mother and Osmond formed another group to which
still another was attached. Homer had found a seat
at Mrs. Leland’s feet, resting his head against her
knee, her hand gently toying with the clustering
locks. The boy said scarcely a word, only listened.
Mrs. Leland had also very little to say, only now
and then a casual word. The brother and sister,
however, who until a few days ago had been as
strangers, had much to tell, and were opening their
hearts, one to the other. Margaret was delighted
with the gems she found stored away in this boy’s
mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>While in this quieter mood they were surprised
by a sudden burst of melody from the piano,
evoked by the touch of a master hand. Nesbit having
confessed to Alice that he was musically inclined,
that bewitching morsel of humanity had so importuned
him that, unable to resist, he soon found his
heart swelling with emotion as he evoked the rich
strains. This burst scattered the groups, and once
more they formed into one whole circle. Nesbit’s
music was followed by singing and then by Margaret’s
selections, then in what seemed a very short
space of time, Cora and Owen were again of their
number, and finally, when the good nights were
spoken it seemed there never had been quite such a
feeling of content lodged in the innermost recesses of
every heart then and there present.</p>

<p class='c005'>The following day brought back the two newcomers
at quite an early hour. They did not now
protest against coming. They were there every day
and evening, until the hour of Margaret’s departure
drew nigh. How brief the time allowed them had
seemed. Wilbur drank in the glory of the blue wells,
kissing the dewy lips again and again. Mrs. Leland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>folded her child close. It seemed almost harder to
let her go now than it had been the first time. Osmond’s
eyes grew dim.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I did not know how dear a sister might be. It
will seem like a dream, if I must give you up so
soon.” And although Margaret’s heart was sad she
tried to hide it under a smiling exterior.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind,” she said. “It will not be for
long. A few short months will soon pass by, then a
long summer will be ours to do with just as we see
fit—a long delicious summer of enjoyment and
planning. Listen! they are planning now. We are
in that, and must hear all about it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Slipping one hand through Osmond’s arm, the
other arm about the waist of her mother she drew
them to where the others had drawn a circle about
Hilda who, having been importuned, was trying to
make plain that vague sweet dream of her future
co-operative home, and none so attentive, or none
more so than Owen. She spoke of the spacious
halls where the ardent searchers after knowledge of
any kind might find their teacher; of the library
stocked with volumes from the ceiling to the floor;
of the lecture hall and the theater; of the opportunities
where every talent could be cultivated; of the
liberty—the free life—where every fetter should be
broken; of the dining hall where they would partake
of their evening meal midst flowers and music;
of the common parlor where every evening should be
an entertainment for all wherein love and genuine
sociability should always preside; of the sacred
privacy of the rooms where each man or woman
should reign king or queen—the sanctum of each,
closed to all intruders, consecrated to the holiest
and divinest of emotions and self-enfoldment. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>spoke of the grand conservatories filled with choicest
flowers—the sweet-scented blossoms, the trailing
vines, the exotic plants; of the spacious gardens, the
sparkling, ever-playing fountains; of the delicious,
health-giving baths; of the life of unconventionality,—of
the abandon; of the nursery rooms where baby
lips were lisping their first words and little toddling
feet taking their first uncertain steps; of the things
of beauty surrounding the prospective mother; of
the unutterably sweet welcome that awaited each
coming child; of the full understanding that would
be taught to woman of the responsibility of calling
into a life a new being; of how man would revere
her, how he would wait and abide her invitation; of
the sweet co-operation and planning how all should
be worked to keep up the financial part.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O,” said she, “it should, it would be paradise!—this
my dream. But ah me! it is only a dream.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As a being transfixed Hilda stood among them,
her eyes shining, her cheeks glowing, her bosom
heaving, looking far beyond them into space. A
feeling came over Lawrence Westcot as with bated
breath his eyes rested on her, of how utterly unworthy
he was of the love of a creature so grand, so
superior. A still, small voice whispered, “Make
yourself worthy!”—and then and there a high resolve
was formed in his mind that he would surely do so.
A solemn vow rose as a silent prayer from the depths
of his heart that some day he would realize that
sweet invitation. With him every man in the room
became conscious of a feeling of inferiority, but not
an impulse to bow in humility. Rather each head
was crested higher with a feeling of lofty aspiration.</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen Hunter answered the closing remarks
of Hilda’s dream picture:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>“Why, my dreaming maiden, should your
dream be but a dream?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A sad smile played about her lips,</p>

<p class='c005'>“You forget that it is such an expensive one.
It would take a fortune, an almost limitless fortune,
to build us such a home. Of course we could be
very, very happy in our little circle, as it is, in a
much smaller and less expensive home, but I would
have it large, so that we might welcome all who
possess the same lofty thought to our circle, so that
we should be able to give to the world an object
lesson in the art of making life worth living, so
grand and so glorious that the whole world would
want to imitate our example.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What an enthusiast! Take my advice, little
one, and until this grand, this glorious home can be
ours, help us with your lofty aspirations, and help
us not to despise our more limited advantages and
privileges. In the meantime we will try to become
more worthy of so perfect a home—as some years
must of necessity elapse ere it can be completed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have I not said it is only a dream? How can
I dare to hope it could ever be realized; and when I
come to this home, day after day, and realize what
privileges are ours the feeling sometimes comes to
me, how wrong-headed I am to be constantly sighing
for still more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen shook his head,</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are mistaken, Miss Hilda. Your sentiments
and aspirations are not wrong. Harmonious
and beautiful as is the life that has been granted you
through the mutual understanding and sympathy of
our kind host and hostess, it is by no means complete.
So dream on, plan on, and if there is an architect in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>our circle he shall transfer these plans to paper, and,
as soon as practicable, we will look about us for a
suitable site, and when the spring sunshine calls all
nature again to life, work shall begin, and what has
so long been only a vague dream shall, all in good
time, bloom into a living reality.”</p>

<p class='c005'>All eyes hung on the lips of the speaker. All
ears drank in his words. Could such a thing be
possible? Only Cora seemed to understand. Pressing
close to his side, she drew his hand with a caressing
motion to her smiling lips. With a hasty movement
he withdrew the hand to lay it on the head
covered with the soft fluffy hair; he pressed it close
to him. Hilda drew a step nearer and extending
both hands,</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean——O, Mr. Hunter! do you really
mean that it can be done? that the home can and
shall be ours? But how? how?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Cora slipped down upon her knees at Hilda’s
side and caught both hands in hers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did I not tell you long ago, when I told you
that story of my heartaches and my noble lover, that
he possessed almost limitless wealth? He could not
be one of us did he not consecrate some of his millions
to the happiness of others. It is in his power to lay
the foundation stone for the future ideal society,
giving to the world an example of how people should
live. Don’t you see, my Hilda? Owen is wealthy,
and is going to build us our home.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>From that day forth a new life entered the
charmed and charming circle. Lawrence proved to
be the architect required, though he had never called
his talent in this line to a practical account. Guided
by Hilda’s vivid imagination, inspired by her enthusiasm
and aided by the practical suggestions of
Owen, the plan grew, and by the time the first green
of the young spring appeared upon the landscape
they were ready for action. Margaret had left them
at the call of duty, and could only from afar share in
the excitement and enthusiasm. Every heart was
beating high with hope, and with the advent of
warmer weather, Owen, Wilbur, Lawrence and
Norman kissed their loved ones good bye and started
on a prospecting tour.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Leland was importuned to remain with the
girls. Why should she return all alone to her
western home?—though the probability now was that
the west would be where their new home would be
located. Just at this time, too, came the change
that caused the sisters’ eyes to grow dim with tears
and a feeling of sadness to pervade every heart.
Frank was daily growing weaker, his cheek more
hollow and white, his hands more waxy, and intuitively
the girls clung to the more mature woman.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>On a bright sunny morning in the early part of May
the tired lids closed, never to open again. Although
almost every day brought a letter from some one of
the absent ones yet they were still far-away when the
death angel made his entrance into the midst of this
happy circle, subduing their spirits with infinite sadness
when they realized so well what had caused this
painful result. So Frank’s body was laid away to
sleep beneath the daisies, and Imelda’s and Cora’s
tears mingled as they knew that another bond was
broken—only they two remained, united by ties of
blood, but they also realized that it was better so.
At best he had been to them but a wreck of what he
might have been. Margaret had joined them just in
time to lay a flower upon his pulseless breast and was
now with them again for a brief time.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young physician, Paul Arthurs, and Milton
Nesbit had settled close by, and Paul was beginning
to have quite a practice as he was fast becoming
known. For some time however, something seemed
to have been secretly gnawing at his heart, and when
his manner had been warmest towards the stately
Edith he would suddenly and abruptly leave her,
until his conduct became quite an enigma to her.
One morning he laid a pack of written papers in her
hand and told her to read, and——ah, well! why
dwell upon a sad story longer than absolutely necessary?
He loved the queenly girl but was conscious
of such a lack of worth on his own part that he felt
it would be best to give her up. Somewhere under
the green sod slept a woman whom he believed the
poison of his own body had murdered. Having first
made a wreck of himself, almost, by early transgressions,
the meaning of which he had been ignorant
of, he had later contracted the germs of a loathsome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>disease. In his unpardonable ignorance he married
a sweet, confiding, loving girl whom he loved with
all his heart but whom he irreparably wronged by
permitting his poisoned manhood to mingle with her
pure womanhood; and when her baby girl was laid in
her arms her eyes closed in that sleep that knows no
waking, and the baby slept with her—under the circumstances
the very best, probably, that could have
happened. He was quite young when all this occurred—in
the early twenties, a period of his life he
never liked to think of. It was after that experience
that he gave himself up to the study of medicine, and
then he underwent a most rigid course of treatment,
including very stringent rules or habits of diet,
bathing and open air exercise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can now look a pure woman in the eyes and
know of a certainty that no harm can come to her
through me, but for all that, the past is a blur upon
my life, a stain which nothing can ever wash away.
One word from you, my heart’s queen, will send me
to my place and keep me there. I could not accept
the sweet love shining in your eyes when I know my
utter unworthiness, without laying bare the past, the
memory of which follows me like a mocking fiend.
Sweetheart, say but the word and I will never become
an inmate of that home which now is being
planned—if you deem me too impure, too unworthy
to associate with the unsullied whiteness that will
congregate there. But O, my darling! I love you as
only a man can love when his manhood’s strength is
most fully developed; but I must abide the verdict
you may render.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours suppliantly,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Paul</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>And what had been sweet Edith’s verdict? When
next they met it was in the garden, under the blossom-laden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>trees. Paul was sitting with his head
resting on his hand unaware of her approaching footsteps.
From the rear she approached until she stood
close to his side, when without a moment’s warning
two soft warm hands drew his head back, two warm,
dewy clinging lips were touched to his bearded ones,
and the next moment he was pressing his cherished
Edith to his heart, pouring all the pent up love of a
strong nature into her willing ears. His errors of
the past belonged to the past. She saw only a noble
manhood to which she felt it would be safe to trust
her womanhood.</p>

<p class='c005'>About this same time, also a strange restlessness
took possession of Nesbit. A nightly visitor at
Maple Lawn, he seemed to enjoy the society of the
fair women there with the keenest relish. Alice’s
slight figure seemed perpetually dancing before his
eyes and a great longing filled his heart. Alice, too,
was restless. The color would rush in waves over
her face at the sound of approaching footsteps. Although
he saw and understood, yet he never said a
word. With all the sweet possibilities the future so
temptingly held out to him he kept his lips firmly
closed while he knew full well that this fair little
woman might be his for the asking.</p>

<p class='c005'>One morning in early June Nesbit electrified
them all by abruptly saying that he was going to
New York. All looked their surprise. Margaret
asked,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice nervously plucked the first full-blown rose
to pieces as her color changed from red to white and
white to red, but Margaret’s question was evasively
answered. Again she asked,</p>

<p class='c005'>“When will you return?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>To which she received a short, “I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Bidding them all good bye he turned to go, when
his eye rested for a moment on the swaying form of
Alice who found it difficult to stay the hot tears. He
hesitated a moment then, approaching the spot where
she stood, in a low voice said,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come with me down the maple walk.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Silently they walked until they reached the end,
then,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you know why I am going away?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because my heart yearns for you, and in that
vast city dwells a woman whom I call wife. She has
not been what the world calls true to me, yet I have
treasured her long and faithfully. I feel I ought not
to speak of love to another woman so long as she
may have need of me. I know it was her own hand
that cast the dice, yet I feel that I must know her
fate ere I entirely cut loose from her. Oh, I loved
her, Alice, in the days when she was mine, and still
a latent tenderness lingers in my heart. Maybe she
was not wholly to blame, but I have learned new
lessons since. I feel a little woman here would prefer
me to all others and my heart yearns to claim her.
Will you kiss me just once ere I start on this journey
which may bring me I know not what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Tenderly he raised the drooping head and forced
the downcast eyes to look into his. It was too much.
Two lips quivered pitifully, like those of some
grieved baby, and two great tears rolled over her
cheeks down upon the snowy whiteness of her gown.
The sight robbed him of self-control. He gathered
her in his arms, the tiny morsel, and held her there
like some wee baby.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I only want to see that she does not suffer; that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>she is taken care of, and then I will return. Indeed
I will. Do not fear”—and then he was gone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus Milton Nesbit left Maple Lawn and the
charmed circle it contained, and another day brought
him to old familiar scenes; brought him to the home
where he had loved and suffered. It was Annie who
opened the door in answer to his ring. Pale-faced,
with a trace of tears about the eyes, with a gasp she
caught her breath as she saw and recognized the man
before her. He saw the effect of his appearance upon
her and a great pity welled up his heart for her.
Calmly he greeted her with,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you not bid me enter?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hesitatingly she did so; speaking never a word,
only stepping back she threw open the door of the
well known little parlor. Within its cool shade he
took both her hands in his,</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Annie? Trust me—tell me all. I
have not come to censure you but to see that you are
cared for. Has that scape-grace brother of mine——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t,” she said, “Don’t blame him. He may
be faulty, but he loves me. Ah, yes, he loves me
more than I deserve. I made him reckless with my
foolish cravings. Every wish of mine was satisfied.
I could not realize that ten thousand dollars was not
a limitless fortune, and when Robert, always delicate,
broke down altogether, we were almost penniless. I
tried then to repay him. I nursed him and I worked
for him. All the pretty things he gave me I again
sold, but I am afraid I cannot retain him. He is
slipping away from my grasp, and oh! I love him so,
I love him so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Almost choking, the words broke from her in a
smothered sob. Her hands went up to her face and
the tears trickled down through the thin, white fingers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>as the sobs shook her frame. A lump rose in Milton’s
throat,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take me to him!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will say nothing harsh or unkind?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She asked it with a fearful tremor in her voice.
He took one trembling hand in one of his, the other
with a gentle caressing motion he laid on the brown
head,</p>

<p class='c005'>“When was I ever so unkind to you that you
should fear me now? Lead on, little girl. He is my
brother, and he is sick.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With an effort she checked her sobs and dried
her tears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come,” she said. He followed her up the stairway
into what had once been their joint bedroom, and
there reclining upon a lounge at the window, his
eyes wandering wearily, lay Robert. Pain and care
had made sad havoc with the delicate frame. Annie
glided to him and knelt at his side laying her cheek
to his hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Robert,” she said softly, “Robert, someone
has come to see you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Turning from the open window his eyes fell upon
the brother they both had so wronged; his face
became ghastly,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Milton, you here!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Milton stepped forward,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Softly, brother—no undue excitement. I bear
you no ill will. I have learned to realize that it was
not all your fault. It was all the outcome of circumstances
over which none of us had any control.
I have not come to censure you, but to look after
your welfare. Without means, how can Annie give
you the care you need?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Robert scarcely could believe he heard aright,</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>“You do not hate me, then—me, the destroyer
of your happiness? Oh, you mock me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No! I do not mock you. True, you both have
caused me suffering, but it was only the cleansing
fire needed to purify the grosser part of my nature.
I don’t blame you now—it was only natural. What
is it your doctor prescribes for you? I want to see
you get well and strong, and you can not do so with
the load of anxiety I know your heart is burdened
with.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Annie bowed her head and wept, and Robert was
too weak to restrain the tears that would start.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, Milton,” said Annie, “you are good; you
are noble; how can we ever repay your kindness?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tush! tush! little woman; say no more about
it, but answer my question. What is it the doctor
prescribes?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, he prescribes what is far beyond our
means,” sobbed Annie. “An ocean voyage may do
wonders for him, the doctor says; and a tour in
foreign lands. The sunny skies of Italy, the mountain
breezes of Switzerland—a summer’s sojourn
there might give him such health as has never been
his.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Milton stepped to the nearest window and gazed
meditatively into—nothing. This would take more
money than be had at his command, although he had
quite a snug sum with which many necessities could
be procured for the sick brother, but that was all.
Should he call for aid upon the friend who had already
been all too generous to him? Why not?
Did he not know that his call would not be in vain?
and was not the life of his brother at stake, and also
the happiness of the woman who had once been all
in all to him? These facts were now uppermost in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>his mind; all else was forgotten. Yes! he would ask
Owen to aid him. So turning from the window he
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cheer up, Annie, Robert shall have his voyage
and tour, and you shall go with him. And when you
return I hope to see the roses blooming in your
cheeks. Possibly it may be wisest for you to remain
abroad several years, spending your summers in the
mountain air, your winters in the sunny south, in
balmy Italy. In return I only wish to be kept posted
as to all of your movements, I want regular reports
as to the state of your health and when you are ready
to return I may have something to tell you which I
think will surprise you as much as you have been
surprised today.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In this strain he went on leaving them neither
time nor opportunity to say much. Preparations
were immediately begun. A telegram was sent to
Owen. In a few days the required amount in ready
cash was at their disposal, and two weeks from the
day Milton first appeared at the side of his brother
he saw him and Annie safe on deck the steamer
“Anchor,” surrounded with every comfort money
could buy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Be judicious with your supply of money,” was
his parting injunction. “Let past experience be a
warning. It is to regain your health you are taking
this voyage. Remember and be wise.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Robert’s answer had been,</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will! so help me the memory of my noble
brother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As Milton bade Annie good bye, clasping her
hand in his, he for a moment looked deep into the
starry eyes, then bending he touched his lips tenderly
to hers. Thus he left them. “Will it be for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>good?” he asked himself. “Ah, well; time will
tell!” Twenty-four hours later he held Alice in his
arms, pressing burning kisses upon her sweet lips,
while Lawrence saw and understood all. For Lawrence,
in company with the others, had returned during
Milton’s absence, and could well afford to smile,
for had not a pair of serious gray eyes smiled him a
welcome which had the promise of heaven in it?</p>

<p class='c005'>What had been the result of the prospecting
tour? A rare, sweet spot of Mother Earth had been
found, with just enough of rugged wildness to show
to advantage nature’s grandeur. Mountains in the
distance; a rolling, undulating country; a winding
river and the glassy bosom of the lake. Last, but
not least, the towers and chimney pots of a distant
city. All this could be seen from the rounded knoll
gently sloped to its base, around which wound a
merry rippling brooklet.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thence a level meadow land which could be laid
out in lovely lawns, parks and drives. Still farther
on patches of woodland to the right and left; meadows
with lowing cattle; a charming spot indeed, surrounded
by nature’s loveliest scenes. Only about
ten minutes walk to the little station-house south of
the knoll, where almost every hour of the day trains
passed and stopped, and which in forty minutes
would carry you to the heart of the city. But it was
not until the early days of August that ground was
broken and work begun upon the mansion that was
to stand a pattern and a beacon for the generations to
come. The winter months put an end to the work
and the long stormy evenings were again spent as
before. But again spring returned and again the
work was resumed.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same time hot-houses were built; a vineyard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>laid out; orchards planted with rare fruit trees,
and berry patches cultivated. Grounds were laid
out; drives made; miniature lakes appeared; grassy
knolls; groups of trees; charming arbors; inviting
summer-houses; cozy retreats and lovers’ nooks. To
produce all this meant work—work to many willing
hands; bread to hungry mouths. Owen paid the bills
with generous hand, while each day at lunch time the
workers enjoyed an hour or two of repose and shelter
from the sun.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Another winter came and still the home was not
finished, but now the work on the buildings could
still go on, as it was mainly within doors and under
shelter. In the heated rooms the skilled workmen
found their tasks easy, and under their hands the
rooms were rapidly turned into bowers of beauty and
use. The gardeners were kept busy during all the
winter months and in the early springtime commenced
their outdoor work of beautifying the place.
Fountains, statues and other objects of beauty and
use grew as if by magic. The hot-houses and conservatories
were wonders of beauty and elegance.
Then came the work of furnishing the building.
Again money was not spared to make everything
perfect. Every nook and arch contained some rare
piece of art—of sculptured work. Exquisite paintings
graced the walls. Breakfast and noonday meals
were to be taken in what was called the breakfast
room. This room was arranged simply for comfort—warm
and cozy for the winter, cool and shaded for
the summer. The furniture was covered with leather.
The breakfast was to be simple, consisting principally
of milk, grain foods and fruits. The mid-day
meal to which it was expected few would gather was
again simple—fruits and nuts playing a leading part.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>But in the evening when all should be gathered
together to enjoy as well as eat—but we are anticipating—too
eager to lift the veil from the future.
Let us wait, rather, until all our dear friends shall
be gathered, to partake of their first evening meal
here in the new home; for the present let us go on
with our description of this glorious structure.</p>

<p class='c005'>And yet, how shall we describe it? The most
vivid fancy fails to do it justice. The corridors,
whose floors are inlaid with tile; the marble staircases;
the painted walls; the carved ceilings; the cozy
private rooms—each in itself a gem; books and music
to be found in them all; each a sanctum for the owner
thereof. The library, the music room and the
drawing room, each perfect as to form and dimensions;
each flooded with brilliant light, or softly toned
down as the fancy would demand or occasion call for,
yet all arranged so as not to cause needless work.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was the desire and expectation of this happy
household to have such only move about the rooms
as were fairly intelligent and cultured. “We don’t
want them to be servants, who do the work in this
home.” Owen had remarked, “but comrades and
mates, each doing a share. No drones. Drones and
idlers do not deserve to enjoy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Among the details worthy of particular mention
were the bath rooms. Not little tubs wherein one
person could scarce recline, but a bath in which the
bather could splash and swim and romp, not a bath
in which false modesty would allow a single occupant
only, but one in which a bevy of bathers could enjoy
the luxury at the same time. Hot and cold water;
steam baths and shower baths—O what a blessing in
the cleansing, purifying element! bringing health
and strength to all who are wise enough to rightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>use it. Just watch the healthy babe in the bath, as
it kicks and splashes and screams with delight.
Was there ever a more beautiful sight?</p>

<p class='c005'>Then we come to a wing of this grand building
which as yet was, and for a little while would be,
closed. Not that this wing was not furnished or
completed in every little detail, but the use to which
it had been dedicated was not yet here. One or
more hearts were waiting and hoping for love’s crown—in
more than one breast the expectation was strong
that at their knock the mystic door would open.
What was this mysterious wing? The sanctum of
the prospective mother!</p>

<p class='c005'>Here she was to be surrounded by every beauty
and comfort that art could supply and that money
could buy. Wherever her eyes should turn they
would rest upon representations of nature’s most
perfect work—the nude human form! From the
little dimpled cupid to the graceful undulating curves
of the perfect woman and the outlines of the strength
and beauty of the perfect man. Here was the workshop
of art. The expectant mother would here be
taught to mold the clay, to use the pallet and brush
or in the quiet and rest secured her here she could
learn to wield the pen. Her gems of thought would
thus influence and mold the mentality of her unborn
child, and would leap like flashes of sunshine to the
world without. Here the builder of the coming
child could withdraw to perfect rest and quiet, and
here she could steep her soul in music and poetry,
and the child which was asked for, which was longed
for and demanded, as a pledge of love—the child
which was begotten under holiest influences and
gestated under such perfect surroundings—could such
a child be anything else than ideal? anything less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>than divine? Released from all the old superstitions
of right and wrong; seeing absolutely no wrong in
holy love, with a conscience that waits not for sanction
of church or state for the consummation of love,
but follows only nature’s dictates,—who would dare
to set the seal of impurity upon the product of such
desires, such holy aspirations, such hopes and such
longings! Gently, reverently, we close the door of
this holy of holies until it opens again to the knock
of the favored one.</p>

<p class='c005'>Is there still more to tell? O yes much more,
but space and language fail. We cannot tell you
half there is to tell. There is the concert hall, the
lecture hall, the dancing hall, the theater—all awaiting
their turn to be unlocked, for hope is strong
within the breasts of the little band that their number
will not always be so small, but that in a few short
years every room in the spacious building will have
its occupant, every hall its throngs of visitors.</p>

<p class='c005'>In still other rooms beyond, where baby-life is
to thrive, the cooing, kicking, little mortals will not
be wanting. Where the nurse, to whose care the
little treasures are to be entrusted, fully understands
the responsibility of her work. No gorging her
little charges with sweets, souring their little
stomachs; no dosing with soothing syrups and paregorics,
sleeping potions, horrid teas and what not,
dulling and stupefying their brains and destroying
the natural brightness of the child’s mentality. O
no! This nurse understands better what is for the
good of the dimpled, rollicking morsels of humanity
entrusted to her care, and as a result she can sleep
soundly the long night through. The babes do not
disturb her. The perfectly healthy treatment they
receive lulls them to sleep and they lie coiled up like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>downy balls, the chubby fists resting on the dimpled
cheeks. What heart would not such a picture
gladden?</p>

<p class='c005'>Are we anticipating again? The picture is so
alluring that we cannot help letting our imagination
wander, sometimes, but we must return and bring
our friends to the now finished home.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was the close of a sultry summer day, late in
August, when Owen, stepping abruptly into the
midst of our friends at the Westcot mansion, said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Our home is finished! When will you be ready
to start for the new quarters?”</p>

<p class='c005'>This question, though long expected, was not
readily answered. All were eager to start, yet much
was still to be attended to. The Westcot home had
been sold, as it stood, with all its handsome furnishings.
The younger Wallace children had lived, during
the past year, almost wholly at the Westcots,
though Mrs. Wallace had at first demurred not a
little. But as the change in them grew daily more
apparent she had fully consented, and had left them
almost entirely to the management of her stepdaughters.
In the spacious grounds of the Westcot
place they were taught to play and romp and enjoy
themselves in a style they had never known. The
plan of sending them to boarding school had been
given up. A boarding school education was fashionable—yes,
but horribly demoralizing. It was to be
purchased at the expense of sparkling eyes and glowing
cheeks. “Better not,” Edith had said. “Mrs.
Westcot’s little girls are taught at home; why not
give these girls home lessons also?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Accordingly Edith taught them their grammar,
their arithmetic and geography. Hilda heard their
reading and spelling and superintended their writing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>Imelda taught them music and drawing while Cora
cultivated their voices.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were now no longer overburdened with
long hours of study, when body and brain were
weary. There was now plenty of time for healthy
romping games, long strolls in the shady woods
where they became interested in the mysteries of
botany, and when evening came, though the day had
been so pleasant the curly heads scarce touched the
pillows ere sleep had closed the tired lids, not to
open again until the morning sun peeped in at the
eastern windows.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boys received similar treatment. As Paul’s
clear and experienced eye almost instantly detected
the cause of the evil that was threatening to make a
wreck of their young lives, the same methods had
from the first been made use of to fill their unemployed
hours.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such had been the lives of our friends, and now
came the task of moving, or of emigration. The old
familiar scenes, the walks and drives, the groves
and the cooling fountains, would know them no
more. Mr. and Mrs. Wallace had long since known
of this project and it was with sincere regret they
saw the day approach when they should say good
bye to these elder, and at one time considered burdensome
children. But far worse than they had expected—their
younger children refused to remain
behind, but insisted on going along to the new home.</p>

<p class='c005'>At first Mrs. Wallace would hear none of it, but
as they begged so hard, and were seconded by all the
members of the “colony,” she finally gave her consent.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course it is not to be supposed that Mr. and
Mrs. Wallace, especially the latter, fully understood
the nature of the home to which her children were to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>be taken. She was too thorough a woman of the
world to countenance a scheme so unconventional, so
outlandish. She only knew that it was a co-operative
home her children were going to; that they had
become bright, healthy and strong since she had
given them into the care of her stepdaughters, and
as she knew she would now have to send them away
again to complete their education she wisely concluded
it was better to send them where she felt assured
they would be properly cared for, and more so
as it was just as easy for them to come home on a
vacation from the co-operative home as from any
other school. And—yes, she could go to see them.
The invitation had been tendered her, so that matter
was satisfactorily settled.</p>

<p class='c005'>Osmond, too, had a severe battle to fight. His
life for the past two years had been a series of battles.
His father had soon discovered the presence of
Osmond’s mother, and knew of his visits to her.
With a volley of oaths he had issued the command
that Osmond should never go near her again. To his
surprise the boy not only demurred to this but
firmly declared that he would go to see his mother
as often as he desired. Almost dumb-founded the
father shouted:</p>

<p class='c005'>“What! Court the society of that outcast! that
shameless creature who knows not the meaning of
the word decency? the woman who——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No more of that!”—came in firm, almost defiant
tones from the lips of the boy. “You have
slandered the best and purest of women long enough—the
woman I am proud to own as my mother! An
accident made me acquainted with her and with her
friends, and never until then did I know what purity
meant, what true manhood and womanhood meant.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>My mother and my sister are women with whom
any man might well be proud to claim kinship. I
will not give up their companionship. I would rather
cut loose from you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Leland stormed, fumed and cursed, but to
no avail. The boy was firm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will disinherit you!” he exclaimed. “I will
cut you off without a cent!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do so!” was the calmly uttered reply. “Then
I will find some work to do and will transfer my life
altogether to the side of my mother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At this point Mr. Leland wisely desisted. Somehow
he hoped to circumvent the boy; hoped to regain
full control, forgetting that Osmond’s mind was
daily developing, and that he was now able to think
for himself. So when the son’s intention of going
away with his mother and sister became known another
storm broke loose. But Osmond was firm, and
on the morning that witnessed the departure of the
colonists he appeared with the rest, equipped and
ready for the journey. Meta’s dark head appeared
beside him. She was growing to be quite a big girl
and all along the journey she was his especial care.
His “little sweetheart”—she had been termed long
since, and the grave-faced child was proud of the
title.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>At the close of a warm sunny day they alighted
at “Willow Grove,” the name of the station nearest
their future home. Wagons were in waiting, upon
which their effects were loaded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But we will walk!” said Owen, “only ten
minutes. The exercise will do us good, after our
long confinement with scarcely any movement.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And with an arm encircling Cora’s waist he led
the way. Many were the exclamations of delight as
beauty after beauty unfolded itself before their eyes,
but when a turn in the roadway brought in full view
the imposing stone structure with its many arches
and turrets, its profusion of vines and flowers, a long
drawn “Oh!” escaped from each beholder.</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen drew Cora aside so as to permit the next
couple, Lawrence and Hilda, to be first. Silently
every man bared his head. Lawrence kissed the little
hand resting upon his arm,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Our Hilda’s Home!”</p>

<p class='c005'>With hands clasped above her heart Hilda stood
and gazed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dream realized! Mine the dream, but
yours,” turning to Owen, “the realization. To you
belongs the honor and greatness of this hour.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tut, tut, little one! How worthless my millions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>without the plan,—without the work of the
mighty mind. Have you no wish reserved for the
architect?”</p>

<p class='c005'>With tears suffusing her sight she turned and
extended both hands to Lawrence, who reverently
knelt and bowed his head over them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mine own! I may hope to win you now. To
be worthy of your sweet love!” Edith and Paul
saw, and a quick glance of comprehension flashed
from eye to eye.</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen’s arm encircled his precious Cora and a
mystical silence fell over this band of lovers. Who
of them all could resist the supreme eloquence of the
hour? Margaret leaned her head against Wilbur’s
shoulder and Wilbur’s dark head was bowed over
Margaret’s fair one, reminding one of “Faust and
Gretchen.” Imelda’s wine-brown eyes were drinking
in the adoration of Norman’s blue ones. Her hands
went up to his face, taking it between them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You understand me now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Long, long ago, my dear one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And a kiss followed the words, a seal, the emblem
of his love and trust.</p>

<p class='c005'>Milton’s hand pressed a blonde head to his breast
and the bright, happy face that is turned up to him
promises oblivion for the dark hours in his past life.</p>

<p class='c005'>Our stately Edith must not be forgotten. A
warm glow suffuses her cheeks as she also is drawn
closer to a manly breast, and glancing up her dark
lustrous eyes meet those of the young physician in
unutterable love and trust.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Leland is looking on; her eyes wander
from the grand structure over the spacious grounds
and thence from couple to couple, every face illumined
with a commingling of love, hope and joy, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>they stand knocking at the door of an unknown
world. Will it fulfill all their expectations? Her
eyes fill with tears. Unconsciously she folds her
hands as she reads the love-lit faces and sees there
the fond hopes that unite each lover couple. Presently
an arm steals about her neck and a cherished
voice says,</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will be your lover, my own mother. You
are too young, by far, to be thus left alone!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She smiles as she answers:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know you are that, my boy, but in time you
will be a true lover of a true and perfect woman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile the younger portion of our band make
themselves more noisily heard. They feel the influence
of the surrounding beauty, and, as is natural,
give vent to exultant cries and shouts. Presently
Elmer’s voice is heard demanding:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I say, why are we all standing out here?
I am hungry and tired; a bath and supper will go good,
I’ll wager.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus admonished a forward movement was again
made, and in a very few minutes the welcoming
portals had opened and received them. Flowers!
flowers! A profusion of flowers everywhere. Each
room had been furnished and decorated with a view
to being especially adapted to the tastes of its future
inmate. Owen took delight in pointing out each
room to its owner. When all had sufficiently admired
their sanctums a half hour was spent in baths
and other refreshments. Pretty, airy and comfortable
dresses were donned. Some of the rare flowers
that filled the vases were fastened in the hair and at
the waists of our happy girls and on the coat lapels
of those of the masculine gender. Then the way to
the drawing room was found, or simply the “parlor,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>as was the term for this surpassingly beautiful room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soon all had gathered in. The lovely “salon”
had been duly admired—such comfort and ease, so
cosy and homelike. Everything beautiful. Rich,
but not too grand for use. Dinner, supper, or whatever
you might choose to call the evening meal, was
then announced, and all repaired to the dining hall.
Have we already described this room? No! Then
we must enter with our dear friends and while noting
the effect upon them we will try to describe, just a
little, what kind of place it was that had been selected
in which to partake of the main meal of the day.</p>

<p class='c005'>An apartment ample in dimensions; high and
arched; with walls of glass to permit the light of day
to flood the place; for other life was here to thrive
than that alone of our free love circle. Rare plants;
palms and cactus; trailing vines; sweet-scented flowers
in great profusion and under canopies as in an
alcove, the dining table had been set, covered with
snowy linen and decked with flowers. Flowers in all
shapes and forms, and of all colors. Above the table
suspended from the ceiling was hung a large bell,
formed of white carnations, held in place by two
cupids floating in the air. The center of the table
held a huge basin of finest porcelain, forming a miniature
pond containing a delicate fountain showering
coolness into the sweet-scented air. The basin itself
filled with the most perfect of water lilies, the golden
centers gleaming in the snowy depths. Vases filled
with rare roses; delicate green wreathings; the various
dishes; while the air was filled with delicious
music,—low and sweet. Luscious fruits, nuts and
sweet new milk, and such simple fare, formed the
chief part of the repast that had been prepared.
Meats and rich pastries had been dispensed with.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>But when had the participants ever enjoyed a meal
more keenly? The folding doors of those transparent
walls had been thrown wide open and the pure
refreshing evening air was wafted to them, bearing
with it the promise of golden future; while jest and
wit and mirth flashed and sparkled like costly jewels
in the bright gas light.</p>

<p class='c005'>But time was gliding by on tireless wings. The
sun was nearing the horizon, casting its last golden
rays aslant upon distant waters of the river, and
farther on the lake, causing the waters to be resplendent
with the reflection of the setting orb. Like a
living, glowing, quivering mass of liquid fire were
the dancing, rippling waves, and all looked on this
display of nature’s charms with a feeling of awe and
veneration. Silently they stood grouped, loving
forms were drawn closer and firmer together as they
watched the grand and glorious sight. Slowly the
glowing orb sank beyond the distant heights; slowly
the waters changed their gleaming brilliance to a
more somber quietness; and as daylight disappeared
ushering in the twilight with its fantastic shadows,
the coming night sent forth its heralds, the weird
humming of the near insects and the occasional hoot
of the distant owl. The rising moon cast its mellow
rays on the peaceful landscape, causing the waters
of the lake in the distance to gleam with a silvery
sheen. All these brought with them a quiet peace
that could never be felt in the heart of the busy city.</p>

<p class='c005'>No music or song thrilled the air on this first
evening in the new home. Hearts were too full for
utterance; too full for mirthful joy. Tired with their
journey, filled with grave and subtile musings our
friends sought quiet rather than mirth. The new
life had begun. Dreams were now to be tested,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>verified, and each and all looked anxiously to the
future—a future filled with hope, with trust, with
high anticipation, and yet never for one moment forgetting
that this same future would bring grave
duties and responsibilities—duties and responsibilities
that would show whether or not this little band of
reformers, of innovators, was composed of the right
elements to achieve success in a comparatively untried
field of human endeavor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXXXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Five years have passed since the dedication of
that beautiful home; years that have brought their
changes; as time invariably does. The mystic rooms—the
sanctum of the expectant mother—have been
occupied, again and yet again. Our royal Margaret
was the first to come under the spell of its sweet and
wonderful influence. Giving herself up to the delightful
occupations provided for in these secluded
rooms, keeping ever in mind the grand result which
was to come of it, one morning after a night of pain
and suspense Wilbur kissed a fine, beautiful, healthy
boy that was laid in his arms. Kneeling at her side
with his head resting on the same pillow with the
fair white face of his peerless Margaret the whisper
greeted his ear:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am blessed today beyond the measure of
women.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Who shall say that his happiness did not equal
her own.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another had not been long in following her brave
example. When Cora’s baby girl was laid upon her
breast Owen’s measure of happiness was filled and
tears blinded his eyes as he kissed the mother of his
child.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two sisters, Edith and Hilda, both brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>joy and happiness to their lovers’ hearts by presenting
them with miniature reflections of themselves,
and Norman had held Imelda’s boy to his heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>By this time the babies that first came to the
new home were making glad the hearts of their
mothers by their childish prattle; some of the mothers
were watching the first trembling footsteps, and now
Alice was waiting, watching for the coming hour.
Milton watched with worshipful tenderness the little
fairy whose love was life to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>New faces also now greet us. New comers have
helped to fill the precious home, who were just as
good and worthy as those whose fortunes we have so
long followed.</p>

<p class='c005'>But to return to the young mothers. They did
not devote all their time to their darling babies. O,
no! Dearly as they loved them they found that they
had other work to do while the little ones were left to
the care of those who were perfectly trustworthy,
Not to be petted, not to be pampered and spoiled, but
left to those who understood how to get to the depths
of each baby nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>When it is remembered what preparation had
been made for their advent it is not surprising that
they were wonderfully good babies. When it is
remembered with what joy they were welcomed—welcomed
while still in the first stages of foetal
growth; how carefully the prospective mothers had
been kept under calm, sweet and pure influences;
how their minds had been kept active without taxing
their strength; how constantly their souls had been
bathed in the luxury of sympathy and love; how
every part of their natures had been kept teeming
with life—overflowing life; how carefully undue
excitement had been warded off; how they were given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>every opportunity for cultivating the higher instincts,—the
spiritual nature;—when all this is remembered
we cannot help seeing that, on the principle of natural
causation, the children of such mothers and of such
influences could not be other than exceptionally well
endowed and exceptionally well behaved.</p>

<p class='c005'>But when the months had passed, during which
the mother should give her personal care and attention
to her cherished babe, it was transferred to the
sole care of the experienced nurse, and she herself
returned to her usual work, whatever that work
might happen to be. There were so many fields
open, and each made her choice. The head gardener
was glad to get help in the tending and nursing of
his plants and flowers. Nimble, dextrous fingers
were needed to fashion the garments to be worn by
the occupants of the home, and this large and beautiful
home needed many willing hands to keep it beautiful.
All this however was work which could be
entrusted to and performed by stronger hands, if
other work should prove more attractive, work in
which more than ordinary intelligence and skill were
required. Among our band were teachers of music
and song, as might be expected of the artist soul
seeking expression. Margaret had kissed her lover
and baby good bye and had given another season to
her loved profession, and had returned again with,
O, such longing and love for the home and the circle
of loved ones it contained.</p>

<p class='c005'>But there was other work. The forty minutes
required to reach the heart of the city were used by
quite a number, morning and evening. In the heart
of the city rose a grand emporium many stories high,
where many hundreds of young women and men
were employed, and which was the property of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>home circle; an emporium which had been built by
Norman and Lawrence and fitted up by Owen, and
which was one of the largest business places in the
great city; an emporium where people of all ages and
sizes could purchase for themselves an outfit from
the crown of their heads to the soles of their feet.
There was the tailor’s department and that of the
dressmaker. There the milliner fashioned pretty
headgear, and there all the beautiful artificial flowers,
of which countless numbers were used from week to
week were made. There the visitor would go from
floor to floor, from department to department, and
would find every place to have its own attraction, its
own work.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the most beautiful department of them all
was that of the florist, where nature’s handiwork
was heaped up in wild and charming confusion, and
where these floral beauties, by deft and cunning
fingers, were arranged into designs without number,
and in this department it was that you could see our
own fair girls moving about, giving orders here,
lending aid there, and again seeing that patrons were
promptly served. All was life, all were busy, yet
none were overworked, as none worked longer than
five hours here. At seven o’clock in the morning
when the doors were opened, they admitted what
was termed the morning “turn.” And when twelve
o’clock announced the noon hour the merry throng,
laughing and singing arrayed themselves for the
street and went trooping out like a merry flock of
birds, for their day of work was over. It was a day’s
work, and thus they were paid. With the striking
of the hour of one, the afternoon “turn” began, and
others filled the places of the morning workers. So
the faces of the saleswomen and salesmen were always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>fresh and smiling, with none of that tired, wornout
appearance that is so often noticeable in the
young faces you meet behind the counter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Where were all these employes housed? Heretofore
as these people generally are housed. Those
who still had a father or mother or both living, lived
with them; in most cases large families crowded into
two or three rooms. Others who were not so fortunate,
had to submit to all the discomforts of cheap
boarding houses, or lived in some stuffy back room
or bleak attic. But a change was about to take place.
Today the large business building is closed. No one
moves about its wide halls and its many departments.
It is a grand “fete” and gala day. Today is to be
dedicated the grand new home which has been
erected for them.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c005'>After two years of life in their co-operative home
its inmates were convinced of its success and felt almost
like thieves that they should enjoy so many
privileges which were beyond the reach of those to
whom they gave employment, and then the plans
were made for a new home, and again Owen’s millions
did service and now a beautiful and grand
structure had been erected. But not so far-away
from the place of work as their own. That would
have been cruelty to the morning “turn” who were
expected to be at their post at the hour of seven, and
equally unpleasant for the afternoon “turn” as it
would cause them to be late for their evening meal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Right on the outskirts of the city, where fifteen
minutes would be all that would be required to bring
them back and forth, a site was bought upon the
brink of the beautiful river, elevated just enough to
be beyond the reach of any possible flood. A park
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>had been laid out which in time would be one of the
handsomest the city could boast of, with its miniature
lakes, its splashing fountains, its dense shrubbery,
its gleaming statuary and flowery banks. And right
in the midst of these beautiful surroundings this
monster home was built. For three long years the
workmen toiled, until when finished it was the finest
of its kind that fancy could depict. A place where
home pleasures would be given the workers, such as
they had never known; where every arrangement
had been made to amuse, to instruct, to educate, to
develop the inmates. It boasted of its school rooms,
its college, its sculpture hall and artist’s studio, its
lecture hall and theater, for which the best of traveling
troupes were to be engaged, with perfect arrangements
for the accommodation of those troupes. Here
the players would not have to undergo the extra
fatigue, after their tiresome work, to again dress for
the street, catch the last cold car which was to take
them to their place of lodging. No, indeed! The
theater of the workers’ home was a marvel of its
kind. Large, airy, comfortable and well furnished
rooms were attached to it, a room to every player, so
near and convenient to the stage that it was not necessary
to dress in little boxes or holes for their work.
Here they could dress in quiet and comfort and then
rest until the signal to begin was given.</p>

<p class='c005'>When through with their work, in the pleasant,
comfortable dining room connected with the theater
for the convenience of this hard-working class of
people—how hard-working few, not of the profession,
ever realize—a simple but refreshing repast
was served, which repast was so restful and had
so much of real comfort in it that the traveling bands
invariably forgot that intoxicants were absent from it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>Then there was a library with its thousands of
volumes containing reading matter of every kind, but
always choice, always select, always instructive. A
large billiard room was also there. Then came the
gymnasium for the development of physical strength
and where both sexes were expected to participate.
There was to be a singing class and dancing school.</p>

<p class='c005'>The baths were not forgotten. Larger, more
complete than at the first home—so many more were
to make use of them here.</p>

<p class='c005'>All arrangements were complete. A large, airy
hall where breakfast and the mid-day meal were to
be served. But here, as in that other home, the
evening meal, which would be the chief meal of the
day, was to be taken amidst nature’s beauties in a
large and beautiful conservatory. Owen had spent a
fortune in furnishing it with the required plants
which were of the rarest kinds. A miniature lake
was formed in its center, wherein the little golden
speckled beauties were dashing and splashing about
in their merry chase. A fountain was reared in its
center composed of half a dozen nude mermaids holding
their hands aloft, their finger tips forming a
circle from which the water was flung aloft in showering
spray. Sweet voiced songsters filled the air
with their thrilling music. Flowers bloomed in wild
profusion; huge vases were filled with their brilliant
treasures wherever they could be suitably placed.</p>

<p class='c005'>At several places small artificial hills had been
erected, ferns and grasses growing amidst the rocks.
Through a small rocky ravine the water came tumbling
into a basin below, forming a small lake.
Palms, cactus and other plants were grouped at convenient
places. Nooks and alcoves without number
had been arranged wherein the tables had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>placed and were now spread and awaiting the hungry
guests, each table seating about a dozen and through
it all rare, sweet music, coming from some hidden
source lulled the tired senses to rest and quiet.</p>

<p class='c005'>The last preparations had been made. The last
garlands had been hung. To every room its inmate
had been assigned, which promised them all the same
sweet privacy when privacy was desired, as in the
first and smaller home. Every room was furnished
cozily and comfortably, and every inmate, if so they
desired, could claim some musical instrument for
their private use, besides which there was a music
hall where first class musical instruments of all kinds
abounded. A number of the best teachers had been
engaged to supervise the different departments, to
teach and bring to light the hidden talents that none
might be lost, but all shine in their full glory.</p>

<p class='c005'>The grounds were something wonderful, or in
time would be so, when the years would have done
their work. The drives were beautiful, so wide and
clean. Ponds covered with waterlilies. Fountains
everywhere. Lover’s nooks and cozy retreats.
Plants, shrubbery and flowers in glorious profusion,
and artistic designs wherever the eye might rest.
Down the sloping banks of the river wide, spacious
stairways of hewn stone had been made which led
down beneath the laving waters. Skiffs, large and
small were moored here, inviting and wooing lovers
of the watery element to trust themselves to its glassy
bosom, to be rocked on its silvery, rippling waves
and be borne whithersoever they might wish.</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen had made a deep hole in his millions.
Lack of funds should not prevent success. And now
the new inmates of this wonderful home were waiting
the summons to their first evening meal. All the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>“salons” of the lower floors were swarming with
gayly dressed maidens and with young men attired
in their best. Instinctively they knew that henceforth
they must always put their best efforts to the
front, and the blending of youthful voices in merry
laughter made the listener glad.</p>

<p class='c005'>But not all were young that were assembled
here tonight. Many there were who had seen the
darker side of life and who in all probability would
prefer the solitude and quiet of their own rooms to
the noisy merry-making of a careless and care-free
youth.</p>

<p class='c005'>And among all those who found a home within
the walls of this magnificent structure those had not
been forgotten whose labor had produced it, had
made it the thing of beauty it now stood. As might
be expected the builders had grown to love it as they
worked, and the knowledge that they should enjoy its
beauties and comforts when finished had stimulated
them to work more eagerly and with extra skill until
the day of its completion.</p>

<p class='c005'>But now all are ready. At last the signal is
given, the doors are flung wide, and just as the music
of a brass band clashes through the resounding halls,
playing a march from one of the master composers,
the workers, all the workers, pour into the monster
conservatory.</p>

<p class='c005'>They thought it was fairy land opened to their
view, floating in a sea of light. Among the rest we
see the members of our own circle, scattered about
here and there, every face radiant with happiness
reflected from within.</p>

<p class='c005'>No waiters are in attendance. At every table
one of the fresh young maidens plays the part of
hostess. On a smaller table near at hand, all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>side dishes have been arranged. Tanks with new
sweet milk, ice water and hot water; nothing that is
likely to be desired has been forgotten or omitted.
The next evening another of the young ladies will be
detailed to preside.</p>

<p class='c005'>When supper is over the tables are let remain as
they are. The day’s work is over. In the morning
many busy hands will restore order, and by noon
everything will again shine with tasteful beauty; the
tables reset, fresh flowers filling all the vases, and the
dishes awaiting refilling.</p>

<p class='c005'>After they have all steeped their senses in the
beauties of the surroundings and have satisfied the
cravings of appetite the evening’s pleasures begin.
Music, song and tableaux have been arranged with
exquisite skill. Cora’s voice has lost none of its
richness, none of its charms. On the contrary it is
more flexible, more sweet and full, more perfect in
every respect, and well it may be. Has she not spent
two years in hard study after they came to the home,
in making herself perfect in her art? At many a
concert, during these years, has her sweet, thrilling
voice been heard, and tonight she almost outdoes herself.
She is perfectly happy and throws her whole
soul into her work; deafening applause rewards her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret’s rendition of “Deborah” meets with
equal favor. She never fails to please.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then follows some renditions of music wherein
Imelda and Milton both excel, for they too have been
spending time in developing their precious talents.</p>

<p class='c005'>The evening’s entertainment then concludes with
a series of tableaux, three in number, entitled “Progress,”
which are received with storms of applause.
They represent “The Past, the Present and the
Future.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>There is one feature that has not been announced
upon the program. One whom we have almost forgotten
to mention has opened the evening’s festivities
with a short address, dwelling on the object, the aim,
the hopes that are to follow the evening’s work.
That one is an old time friend, probably forgotten
by most of our readers. It is an old, white-haired
gentleman with a well preserved air about him. It
is the Mr. Roland, of the lecture room of the olden
days and the fatherly friend of our Margaret and
Imelda, and who is followed by another almost forgotten
friend, the lecturer “Althea Wood.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When the curtain has dropped on the last tableaux
the assembled audience refuses to be satisfied.
They well know whose money has erected the palatial
building and “Owen Hunter! Owen Hunter!” is now
the cry. In response to this call Owen steps upon
the stage and in a slow, graceful manner saunters up
to the footlights. Waiting for the stormy welcome
to subside, then in slow even tones he begins:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Friends and comrades! You do me far too
great honor in thus calling me to the front. What
you term an act of greatness is simply one of justice.
No merit is due to me that I control millions of
dollars while millions of my fellow human beings
this night are starving. My early years were droned
away in luxury, ease and pleasure hunting, and in
all probability I would have gone on thus to the end
had not circumstances given me a shaking up, thereby
showing me something of the darker side of life.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What these circumstances were, what the
means by which the awakening was brought about I
cannot here tell you. The story would be too long.
But I awoke to a sense of the fact that I was of no
use whatever in the world. With the aid of minds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>superior to mine a home was planned, one for a small
number of congenial friends who wished to try co-operation,
and having proved it a success, this one
for the busy bees of our great industrial hive was
next planned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have, until now, been the employes of the
‘Home Company.’ From this day forth you are
partners therein. You will receive your salaries just
the same as heretofore. At the end of the year the
accounts will be squared and a dividend declared with
which you are to pay your rent, so-called, for your
home, but which in reality you are buying. For
when you have paid rent amounting to the sum it has
cost to erect this building, you will be the owners of
it, not I. Moreover, you shall not be taxed with a
shameless interest, and when your home is paid for
and the original capital again garnered in, there will
be countless other employes who are in need of a
home like this, and which it will devolve upon us to
erect. Do you see?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And see they do! Such deafening shouts of applause
never before filled a hall. It is a perfect uproar
and it takes some time ere quiet can again be
restored. Owen smilingly shakes his head——</p>

<p class='c005'>“You do me too much honor, as I have before
remarked. Believe me, you have much more reason
to thank the bright minds and gentle hearts of the
ladies of the ‘Home’ than—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Three cheers for the ladies!”—someone
shouted, and three rousing cheers were given, and
then three more, and yet again three.</p>

<p class='c005'>Owen sees that they are getting excited, and that
he will have but little chance to say more, so he determines
to end it at once.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is all, comrades. With the best of wishes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>for the future well being of your home, and with the
sincerest hopes for the happiness of each of you I
bid you good night—as I see it written on many
bright, young faces that their restless feet are anxious
for the dance to begin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Another deafening round of applause follows.
They would recall him but Owen will not respond.</p>

<p class='c005'>The crash of music is then heard, sending forth
its inviting strains, and soon the light footsteps trip
to the measured chimes and the hours speed in happy
merriment.</p>

<p class='c005'>With such surroundings, such inducements, it
will not be difficult to keep the young maidens fresh,
healthy and pure-minded, and to keep the young men
away from the influence of drink, of vice, of demoralization.
No danger that they will unsex themselves
through starvation of their sex natures. The
needed magnetism is theirs through their constant
mingling, and while this is only the beginning, while
they have so much yet to learn, there is every hope,
every evidence that the home will develop fine,
healthy and intelligent women, strong, brave and
noble men.</p>

<p class='c005'>Already Owen has another home planned, to be
situated farther out into the open country. “Products
of the soil” will furnish the chief employment
of this group of workers. Not all men and women
prefer the bustling city life. There are many who
cannot live and enjoy life away from nature. They
would pine for the open air, the green fields, the
cool shade of the woods. Only under the blue vault
of heaven can happiness come to them. And for
such as these also it is the desire of our friends to
secure the advantages that only the co-operative
home can supply. Owen is determined to show that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>his millions have not been vainly entrusted to his
care, and that the advantages that wealth can procure
shall be theirs to whom the wealth justly belongs—the
producers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here we must leave the inmates of the just completed
and dedicated home, on the threshold of their
new life, and take one more farewell word to our
friends of the “F. L.” home—the children of my
fancy, who have grown under my care, and who
have become inexpressibly dear to me.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>CONCLUSION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The evening meal is over. All have gathered on
the broad veranda to watch the golden sunset as it
dips its slanting rays in the river beyond. They are
unusually quiet, even for this serious band. Last
night’s merry-making has made them just a little
tired, besides which their hearts are full of unuttered
prayers for the future success of that new home.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Leland is sitting in the comfortable depths
of an easy chair. A sturdy little man of four summers
perches upon her knee, patting grandma’s
cheek, tossing her hair in his efforts to smooth it,
taking her face between both chubby hands and
drawing her head forward so that he can kiss her
happy, smiling lips and altogether making love in
the most approved child fashion.</p>

<p class='c005'>Margaret is sitting at her feet, her arm thrown
across her mother’s knee, while her eyes with a
happy, tender light follow the movements of her
boy, and her heart swells with fond tenderness and
pride at the knowledge that he is her very own.</p>

<p class='c005'>At grandma’s back stands Wilbur whose eyes
also follow the antics of the boy when they for a few
moments lose sight of the glorious sunset.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Roland is a visitor at the home tonight, and
sits a little to the right of this group, quietly drinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>in the scene before him in the pauses of the animated
conversation he is carrying on with the brilliant
little lecturer, Althea Wood, who also is a guest
at the home tonight.</p>

<p class='c005'>Farther to the left are various groups. The two
pairs of sisters—Imelda and Cora, Edith and Hilda—have
formed a circle, their babies forming the
center of their attention. There are little prattlers
while one sweet little cooing innocent lies close to
Imelda’s breast.</p>

<p class='c005'>O, the joys of young motherhood! And the
group of men that were standing a little apart felt
the influence of the spell and each thought his sweetheart
had never looked more fair.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alice in delicate health was reclining in an easy
chair while Milton with adoring eyes stood over her
chair ready to do her slightest bidding. O, if she
were only safely tided over the coming hour of trial!
And as the sigh escapes him his hand caressingly
toys with the bright mass of shining hair.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lawrence has his Norma perched upon his knee
answering her many questions. She has grown to be
quite a big girl now, but has never outgrown her
early love for her papa, and ever with the old delight
greets his coming. The two are so near to Alice that
she can comfortably watch them, and while a smile of
proud tenderness wreathes her lips, it is Milton’s
hand to which they are laid.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My baby!” She whispered the tender words.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A little longer patience,” is Milton’s whispered
reply, “and your baby will be your own!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her hand went up to his face with a caressing
touch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know,” she smilingly said, “but it was
Norma I meant this time.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>He drew the hand to his lips as with a knowing
smile he answered,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, I see!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lawrence now and then let his eyes wander to
the mother of his child, then they would turn to the
group of fair young women where a pair of sweet
gray eyes met his in a tender glance, then to rest on
the little one reclining against his bosom. Which
did he love most? His eyes lit up with a glad tenderness
as they rested on the little one and then he drew
the fair curly head so near him, close to his heart
and hid his face in the fluffy masses; could he himself
answer the question?</p>

<p class='c005'>Many other faces we see which are all new to us,
but they are all men and women worthy to be called
by these names.</p>

<p class='c005'>A group of the younger people have strayed
down to the sweet-scented gardens gathering flowers
as they go. Osmond and Homer are fast friends.
Both are young men untouched by the rough hand of
fate. Their young manhood, so perfect in its
strength and beauty giving them the appearance of
young kings, so proud, so lofty, was their bearing.
Elmer, too, could scarcely be termed a boy any
longer. His twenty years sat well on his broad
shoulders and the eyes of the fifteen year old Meta
shone bright as stars, her cheeks flushed as he
chased her through the winding mazes of the park,
and when he had caught her and kissed the rosy lips
she submitted as a matter of course with the most
natural grace.</p>

<p class='c005'>Osmond had thrown himself at the feet of Hattie
Wallace whose nineteen summers sat lightly on her
shoulders. She was such a fairy and with rosy
hued cheeks she listened to the soft, love-freighted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>words that fell in whispers from Osmond’s lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>Homer’s companion was a dark, soft-eyed young
girl timid and shy who had been an inmate of the
home for one year, where she had come with her
mother who had fled in the dead of night from her
husband and sought refuge in this haven of rest, and
Homer was teaching the sweet Katie her first experience
in the mysteries of love.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aleda, the youngest of the Wallace girls was
also there, and seventeen years had developed a truly
pretty and healthy girl from the delicate querulous
child. Another new comer had engaged her attention.
Reading from a volume of Tennyson, a boy
scarce older than herself was reclining at her feet.
He too had been brought there by a mother, not one
who had fled the cruelties of an unappreciative husband,
as she had never applied the title to any man.
He had been a child of love.</p>

<p class='c005'>His mother, in the wild sweet delirium of a first
love, had abandoned herself to her artist lover without
a thought of right or wrong. And he, pure and
noble had no thought of wronging her. But disease
had early marked him for its own, and ere the child
of his Wilma had seen the light of day his own life
had closed in that sleep that knows no waking, and
she was left alone to buffet the storms of life as best
she could, an orphan and without friends. With a
babe in her arms, of “illegal” origin, the path of her
life had not been strewn with roses. But amidst all
her privations and trials she had kept her love pure
for her child and had fostered only instincts pure and
holy in the young mind, and when she heard of the
home she applied at its gates, telling her story in
pure, unvarnished words, never dreaming of an effort
to hide any of her past. Only by the light of truth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>could the delicate fair woman thread her path through
the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>As might be expected, she had been received
with open arms. Wilma, the mother of Horace, our
young poet, and Honora, Katie’s mother, could now
be seen as they stand arm in arm watching the golden
sunset and the children whose future promises to
bring with it less of the pain that has so early drawn
silver threads through their own brown locks.</p>

<p class='c005'>The world at large knew not the full meaning of
this home as yet. The world is yet too completely
steeped in superstition and ignorance to have permitted
its existence had the full meaning been known.
The “Hunter Co-operative Home” it had been called,
and thus it was known to the world. It was known
that babes had made their advent therein, but none
but the initiated knew that marriage as an institution
was banished from its encircling walls.</p>

<p class='c005'>Would you ask us if happiness was so unalloyed
within those walls that no pangs of regret or of pain
could enter there? Well, no! We are not so foolish
as to make such claim. There are hours of temptation;
there are moments of forgetfulness; there are
sometimes swift, keen, torturing pangs that nothing
earthly can completely shut out. Our heroes and
heroines are not angels. They are—when the very
best of them has been said—only intelligent, sensible
and sensitive men and women—but men and women
who are possessed of high ideals and who are striving
hard to reach and practicalize them. They live
in a world of thought. They do nothing blindly, inconsiderately;
their every action is done with eyes
wide open. In trying to gain the goal they have set
themselves to reach, they strive not to think of self
alone. The future of those who have been entrusted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>to their care, the young lives their love has called
into existence, exacts from them much of self-denial.
They are individualists, yet not so absolutely such
that they do not realize that sometimes the ego must
be held in check so as not to rob another of his, or
her birthright.</p>

<p class='c005'>You ask again, “Does this home life, as you
have pictured insure against the possibility of the
affections changing?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And again we answer, No! Certainly not. Such
changes will and must come. Yet it is not to be expected
that where there is liberty, in the fullest sense
of the word, life will be a constant wooing? Is it
not the lack of liberty that deals the death blow to
many a happy, many a once happy home? to many a
home that was founded in the sweetest of hopes, the
brightest of prospects, only to be shattered and
wrecked in a few short years? aye, even a few short
months or weeks? And when such a change does
come, in spite of all efforts to prevent, how great a
thing it must be to know yourself free! free to embrace
the new love without the horrible stigma of
“shame!” as our modern society now brands it, and
which stigma causes such unspeakable misery, such
endless suffering.</p>

<p class='c005'>And if a woman desires to repeat the experience
of motherhood, why should it be wrong when she
selects another to be the father of her, instead of the
one who has once performed this office for her? Why
should the act be less pure when she bestows a second
love, when the object of this second love is just as
true, just as noble, just as pure-minded as was the
first one? Why should an act be considered a crime
with one partner which had been fully justified with
another?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>Reader, judge me not hastily. Judge not my
ideas, my ideals, without having first made a careful
study of life as you find it around you. My words
are backed by personal experience and observation,
experience as bitter as any that has been herein
recorded. Indeed I doubt if I should, or could, ever
have given birth to the thoughts expressed in these
pages had it not been for that experience—which is
one of a thousand—and when you have carefully
weighed my words, think of the good that must result
to future generations when unions are purely spontaneous,
saying nothing of the increase of happiness
to those who are permitted thus to choose, and to live.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c005'>When, O, when will the great mass of humanity
learn and realize that in enforced motherhood, unwelcome
motherhood, is to be found the chief cause of
the degradation that gives birth to human woe.
When will they see that unwelcome motherhood is the
curse resting upon and crushing out the life energies
of woman; while on the other hand, the consciousness
of being the mother of a desired babe, a child
conceived in a happy, a loving embrace, needs no
other blessing, no other sanction, no other license,
than such act itself bestows.</p>
